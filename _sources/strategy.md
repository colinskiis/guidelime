## Search Workflow

### For each specialty:
1. Visit primary organization's guidelines page
2. Identify current (non-superseded) guidelines
3. For each guideline, extract:
   - Full title
   - Publication date
   - URL
   - DOI (if available, usually in the publication)
   - PMID (search PubMed by title if needed)
   - Open access status
   - Guideline type
   - Previous version date (if noted)

### PubMed search for PMIDs:
```
"[Organization]"[Corporate Author] AND "practice guideline"[Publication Type]
```

### DOI lookup:
- Most journal-published guidelines have DOIs
- Check the PDF or journal page
- CrossRef: https://search.crossref.org/

## Priority Order for Initial Population

1. **High-impact US guidelines** (AHA/ACC, IDSA, ADA, USPSTF)
2. **Major international guidelines** (WHO, ESC, NICE, KDIGO)
3. **Specialty-specific** (expand by specialty)
4. **Condition-specific** (fill gaps for common conditions)

---

## Maintenance Notes

- Many societies update guidelines on fixed cycles (e.g., ADA annually)
- Set `last_reviewed` date when adding/verifying entries
- Check for "focused updates" between major revisions
- Monitor society newsletters/RSS for new publications
