## Scope
2024 AMA guidance on safe and effective practices for opioid tapering in patients on long-term opioid therapy for chronic pain.

## Key Recommendations

### When to Consider Tapering
- Patient requests tapering.
- Pain condition has resolved or improved.
- Lack of meaningful functional improvement despite opioid therapy.
- High-dose therapy (≥90 MME/day) without clear benefit.
- Evidence of opioid use disorder (OUD).
- Safety concerns (sedation, overdose risk, comorbidities like sleep apnea).

### When NOT to Force Rapid Tapering
- Stable patients who are functioning well on current dose.
- Avoid involuntary or forced rapid tapers, which can lead to opioid withdrawal, pain crisis, illicit drug use, or suicide.

### Tapering Approach
- **Shared Decision-Making**: Engage the patient in the decision; set individualized goals.
- **Gradual Taper**: Reduce dose by 5-10% per month. Slower tapers are generally safer.
- **Pause if Needed**: Hold or slow taper if patient experiences distress, worsening pain, or withdrawal symptoms.
- **Multimodal Pain Management**: Integrate physical therapy, behavioral therapy, non-opioid pharmacotherapy (NSAIDs, acetaminophen, gabapentinoids, duloxetine, topical agents).
- **Regular Follow-Up**: Frequent check-ins during taper.

### Managing Withdrawal Symptoms
- Alpha-2 agonists (clonidine), anti-diarrheals, antiemetics may help.
- Consider buprenorphine if patient develops OUD or needs medication-assisted treatment.

### Special Considerations
- Patients with OUD should be offered medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD: buprenorphine, methadone, naltrexone) rather than simple tapering.
- Psychiatric support for patients with co-occurring mental health conditions.
