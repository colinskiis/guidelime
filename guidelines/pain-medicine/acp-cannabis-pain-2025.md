## Scope
Best practice advice from the ACP Clinical Guidelines Committee addressing the use of cannabis-based products for adults with chronic noncancer pain.

## Best Practice Advice

### Advice 1: Clinical Efficacy
- **Consider for Selected Patients**: Clinicians may consider the use of cannabis or cannabinoids in adults with chronic noncancer pain who have not responded to standard treatments.
- **Evidence Limitations**: Acknowledge that while some evidence suggests modest pain reduction, the overall quality of evidence for many conditions remains low.

### Advice 2: Risk Assessment and Counseling
- **Discussion of Side Effects**: Counsel patients on potential adverse effects, including:
  - Dizziness, somnolence, and confusion.
  - Risk of dependency or Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome (CHS).
  - Potential cognitive impairment.
- **Psychiatric History**: Use caution in patients with a personal or strong family history of psychosis or schizophrenia.

### Advice 3: Product Selection and Dosing
- **Standardized Products**: Where possible, prefer pharmaceutical-grade products with standardized THC/CBD ratios over unregulated retail products.
- **Starting Dose**: "Start low and go slow" approach to minimize adverse effects.

### Advice 4: Monitoring and Reassessment
- **Frequency**: Regularly reassess pain levels, functional status, and side effects.
- **Discontinuation**: Discontinue use if no significant improvement in pain or function is achieved within a reasonable timeframe (e.g., 4-8 weeks).

### Advice 5: Legal and Occupational Considerations
- **Legal Status**: Discuss the legal status of cannabis in the patient's jurisdiction.
- **Employment**: Advise patients on potential implications for employment-based drug testing.
- **Driving**: Counsel patients against driving or operating heavy machinery while under the influence.
