## Scope
Comprehensive evidence-based recommendations for the use of common interventional procedures (injections, neurotomy) in the diagnosis and treatment of chronic non-cancer spine pain.

## Key Recommendations

### Epidural Steroid Injections (ESI)
- **Radicular Pain**: Recommended for short-term relief of radicular pain due to disc herniation.
- **Transforaminal vs. Interlaminar**: Transforaminal ESI is generally preferred for targeted radicular symptoms, particularly in the lumbar spine.

### Facet-Mediated Pain
- **Diagnostic Blocks**: Strongly recommends dual comparative medial branch blocks (MBB) with high-threshold relief (≥80%) to diagnose facet joint pain before neurotomy.
- **Radiofrequency Neurotomy (RFN)**: Recommended for patients with confirmed facet-mediated pain, providing relief typically lasting 6–12 months.

### Sacroiliac Joint (SIJ) Pain
- **Diagnosis**: Recommends image-guided intra-articular diagnostic blocks.
- **Treatment**: Intra-articular steroid injections may provide short-term relief. RFN of the lateral branches may be considered for longer-term benefit in confirmed cases.

### Discogenic Pain
- **Discography**: Should be reserved for carefully selected patients where surgical planning or specific regenerative treatments are being considered.
- **Thermal Annuloplasty**: Weak recommendation for specific subsets of patients with contained discogenic pain.

### Safety and Performance
- **Image Guidance**: All spinal interventional procedures **must** be performed under fluoroscopic or CT guidance to ensure accuracy and safety.
- **Vascular Contrast**: Use of particulate vs. non-particulate steroids should be based on the level of the spine and the specific procedure (e.g., non-particulate preferred for cervical transforaminal ESI) to minimize catastrophic vascular risk.

### Multimodal Context
- Interventional procedures should be integrated into a broader biopsychosocial management plan, including physical therapy and cognitive-behavioral strategies.
