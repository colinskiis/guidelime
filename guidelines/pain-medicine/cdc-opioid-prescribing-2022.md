## Scope
Updated guidance for clinicians prescribing opioids for outpatients aged ≥18 years with acute, subacute, or chronic pain, excluding cancer-related pain, palliative care, and end-of-life care.

## Key Recommendations

### Determining Whether to Initiate Opioids

#### Recommendation 1
- **Nonopioid therapies** are preferred for acute, subacute, and chronic pain
- Many nonopioid therapies can be more effective with fewer risks
- Exhaust nonopioid options before considering opioids

#### Recommendation 2
- When opioids are used, combine with nonopioid therapies as appropriate
- Opioids should be part of multimodal treatment

#### Recommendation 3
- Before starting opioids, discuss realistic goals for pain and function
- Establish treatment goals focused on functional improvement
- Plan for discontinuation if benefits do not outweigh risks

### Opioid Selection and Dosing

#### Recommendation 4
- Prescribe **immediate-release opioids** rather than extended-release/long-acting (ER/LA)
- ER/LA formulations associated with greater risk of overdose

#### Recommendation 5
- When starting, prescribe the **lowest effective dose**
- Avoid doses ≥90 MME/day when possible
- Carefully reassess benefits and risks if considering ≥50 MME/day

#### Recommendation 6
- For acute pain, prescribe the **lowest effective dose and shortest duration**
- Often ≤3 days sufficient; rarely >7 days needed
- Reevaluate before prescribing additional opioids

### Duration and Follow-Up

#### Recommendation 7
- Evaluate benefits and risks within **1-4 weeks** of starting opioids
- Continue to reassess at least every **3 months** thereafter
- Document ongoing assessment of pain, function, and adverse effects

#### Recommendation 8
- Consider tapering to a lower dose, or tapering and discontinuing, if:
  - Pain and function have not improved meaningfully
  - Risks outweigh benefits
  - Patient requests tapering

### Assessing Risk and Addressing Harms

#### Recommendation 9
- Review **PDMP** (Prescription Drug Monitoring Program) data before starting and periodically during treatment
- Check for concurrent prescriptions from other providers

#### Recommendation 10
- Use **urine drug testing** before starting opioids and consider periodic testing
- Helps identify prescribed medications and undisclosed substances

#### Recommendation 11
- Avoid prescribing opioids and **benzodiazepines concurrently** whenever possible
- Combination significantly increases overdose risk

#### Recommendation 12
- Offer or arrange **naloxone** for patients at increased risk of overdose:
  - History of overdose
  - History of substance use disorder
  - Higher opioid doses (≥50 MME/day)
  - Concurrent benzodiazepine use

### Substance Use Disorder

#### Recommendation 13 (Removed in 2022 update)
- Previous recommendations on specific MME thresholds were modified
- Focus on individualized assessment rather than rigid thresholds

## Key Changes from 2016 Guideline
- Removed specific hard MME limits as mandates
- Emphasized flexibility and individualized care
- Broadened to include acute and subacute pain (not just chronic)
- Added guidance on tapering
- Emphasized importance of continuing opioids when benefits outweigh risks
