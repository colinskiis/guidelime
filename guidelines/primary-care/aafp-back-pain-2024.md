## Scope

This guideline provides recommendations for noninvasive treatment of acute, subacute, and chronic low back pain in primary care settings.

## Key Recommendations

### Initial Assessment
- Exclude red flags (cauda equina, fracture, infection, cancer)
- Imaging not routinely recommended initially
- Neurologic examination for radiculopathy

### Acute/Subacute Low Back Pain (<12 weeks)
**First-Line:**
- Patient education and reassurance
- Self-care and staying active
- Superficial heat

**Pharmacotherapy (if needed):**
- NSAIDs (first-line)
- Skeletal muscle relaxants (short-term)
- Avoid opioids unless other options failed

**Non-Pharmacologic Options:**
- Spinal manipulation
- Massage therapy
- Acupuncture

### Chronic Low Back Pain (≥12 weeks)
**First-Line Non-Pharmacologic:**
- Exercise therapy (most effective)
- Multidisciplinary rehabilitation
- Cognitive behavioral therapy
- Mindfulness-based stress reduction
- Tai chi, yoga
- Progressive relaxation

**Pharmacotherapy:**
- NSAIDs (short-term use)
- Duloxetine (for chronic pain)
- Avoid long-term opioids

### Not Recommended
- Routine imaging for nonspecific LBP
- Systemic corticosteroids
- Bed rest
- Traction
- TENS (insufficient evidence)

### Opioids
- Consider only if non-opioid therapy inadequate
- Short-term use only
- Discuss risks vs. benefits
- Alternatives strongly preferred
