## Scope

Updated recommendations for screening and diagnosis of gestational and pregestational diabetes during pregnancy, and screening for type 2 diabetes postpartum.

## Notes

Updates Practice Bulletins 190 (GDM) and 201 (Pregestational DM) from 2018. Key points: ACOG does not recommend routine GDM screening before 24 weeks due to lack of evidence for benefit. Early screening recommended for individuals with BMI ≥25 or ≥1 risk factor.
