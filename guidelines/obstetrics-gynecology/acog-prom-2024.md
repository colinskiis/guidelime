## Scope
2024 ACOG practice bulletin on the diagnosis and management of prelabor rupture of membranes (PROM) at term and preterm.

## Key Recommendations

### Diagnosis
- **Clinical Diagnosis**: Pooling of amniotic fluid in vaginal vault, positive nitrazine test (pH >6.5), ferning on microscopy.
- **Avoid Digital Exam**: Until active labor or induction; increases infection risk.
- **Ultrasound**: Assess amniotic fluid volume; oligohydramnios supports diagnosis.
- **AmniSure, ROM Plus**: Biochemical tests may be used if uncertain.

### Term PROM (≥37 Weeks)

#### Management Options
- **Induction of Labor**: Generally recommended to reduce risk of infection.
  - Within 12-24 hours of membrane rupture is reasonable.
- **Expectant Management**: May be considered in select patients for up to 12-24 hours with monitoring; higher infection risk with longer latency.
- **GBS Prophylaxis**: Administer if GBS positive or unknown status with risk factors.

### Preterm PROM (pPROM, <37 Weeks)

#### General Approach
- Admit, confirm gestational age, assess for infection, labor, fetal well-being.
- Avoid tocolysis unless for short-term steroid benefit or transfer.

#### Antenatal Corticosteroids
- Administer if 24+0 to 33+6 weeks to enhance fetal lung maturity.
- Consider at 23+0 to 23+6 weeks depending on clinical circumstances.
- May be considered at 34+0 to 36+6 weeks if not previously received.

#### Latency Antibiotics
- Prolong latency, reduce neonatal morbidity.
- **Regimen**: Ampicillin + erythromycin IV x 48 hours, then amoxicillin + erythromycin oral x 5 days.

#### Magnesium Sulfate
- For neuroprotection if delivery expected before 32 weeks.

#### Expectant Management vs. Delivery
- <34 weeks: Expectant management unless chorioamnionitis, abruption, non-reassuring fetal status, or labor.
- 34+0 to 36+6 weeks: Either expectant management or delivery is reasonable (individualize).

#### Chorioamnionitis
- Fever, maternal/fetal tachycardia, uterine tenderness, purulent discharge. Deliver promptly.
