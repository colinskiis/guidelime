## Scope
Updated 2025 ACOG committee opinion providing guidance on the risks of cannabis use during pregnancy and lactation.

## Key Recommendations

### Screening
- **Universal Screening**: Screen all pregnant and postpartum patients for cannabis use as part of routine prenatal care using a validated screening tool and non-judgmental approach.
- **Know Your Laws**: Be aware of state reporting requirements. Positive drug screens should not automatically trigger child protective services referral without clinical correlation.

### Counseling
- **Advise Abstinence**: Because of insufficient data on safety, advise patients to discontinue cannabis use during pregnancy and while breastfeeding.
- **Address Alternative Therapies**: For patients using cannabis for nausea/vomiting of pregnancy (NVP), offer safe and effective first-line antiemetics (e.g., vitamin B6/doxylamine, ondansetron).

### Risks of Prenatal Exposure
- **Fetal Neurodevelopment**: THC crosses the placenta and may affect fetal brain development. Some studies link prenatal exposure to attention and behavioral problems in offspring, though causality is difficult to establish.
- **Adverse Birth Outcomes**: Associated with increased risk of low birth weight and preterm birth in some studies.

### Lactation
- **THC in Breast Milk**: THC is lipophilic and concentrates in breast milk and can be detected for days after use.
- **Recommendation**: Advise against cannabis use while breastfeeding.

### CBD Products
- FDA-approved CBD products are not regulated for purity or dosage. Counsel against use during pregnancy and lactation due to lack of safety data.
