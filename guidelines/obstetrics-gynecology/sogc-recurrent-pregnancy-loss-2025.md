## Scope
2025 update of the SOGC guideline providing evidence-based recommendations for the investigation and management of recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL), defined as two or more pregnancy losses prior to 20 weeks' gestation.

## Key Recommendations

### Investigation
- **Parental Karyotype**: Not routinely recommended for all couples, but should be offered if there is a history of three or more losses, fetal structural abnormalities, or a family history suggestive of chromosomal rearrangement.
- **Antiphospholipid Antibodies (aPL)**: Testing for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies (IgG/IgM), and anti-beta2-glycoprotein I antibodies (IgG/IgM) is recommended after two or more losses.
- **Thrombophilia Testing**: Routine testing for inherited thrombophilias (e.g., Factor V Leiden, Prothrombin mutation) is **not recommended** for RPL, as treatment has not been shown to improve outcomes.
- **Anatomical Assessment**: Pelvic ultrasound or sonohysterography is recommended to evaluate for uterine anomalies (e.g., septum, fibroids).
- **Thyroid Function**: Check TSH, as hypothyroidism should be treated to lower loss rates.

### Treatment
- **Antiphospholipid Syndrome (APS)**: For women with confirmed APS and recurrent loss, treatment with low-dose aspirin plus prophylactic-dose heparin (LMWH or UFH) is strongly recommended and improves live birth rates.
- **Progesterone**: May be offered to women with early pregnancy bleeding and a history of recurrent loss. Evidence for routine use in all RPL patients without bleeding is less robust.
- **Uterine Septum**: Surgical resection of a uterine septum may be considered, though evidence of benefit is limited.

### Unexplained RPL
- **Supportive Care**: Tender loving care (TLC) clinics with supportive care and close monitoring in early pregnancy are associated with improved outcomes.

### Lifestyle Factors
- Counsel on smoking cessation, achieving a healthy BMI, and limiting alcohol and caffeine intake.
