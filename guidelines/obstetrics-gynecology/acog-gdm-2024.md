## Scope

This practice bulletin provides guidance on screening, diagnosis, and management of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).

## Key Recommendations

### Screening
- Universal screening at 24-28 weeks gestation
- Early screening for high-risk individuals (obesity, prior GDM, family history)
- Two-step approach (1-hour GCT, then 3-hour OGTT if positive) recommended
- One-step (75g OGTT) approach is acceptable alternative

### Diagnostic Criteria (Two-Step)
- 1-hour GCT cutoff: 130-140 mg/dL (practice variation acceptable)
- 3-hour OGTT: ≥2 abnormal values diagnostic
  - Fasting ≥95 mg/dL
  - 1-hour ≥180 mg/dL
  - 2-hour ≥155 mg/dL
  - 3-hour ≥140 mg/dL

### Glycemic Targets
- Fasting: <95 mg/dL
- 1-hour postprandial: <140 mg/dL
- 2-hour postprandial: <120 mg/dL

### Management
**Lifestyle:**
- Medical nutrition therapy (carbohydrate counting, balanced meals)
- Regular physical activity unless contraindicated
- Blood glucose self-monitoring

**Pharmacotherapy:**
- Insulin preferred when glycemic targets not met
- Metformin and glyburide may be considered (discuss limitations)
- Titrate insulin for individual glucose patterns

### Fetal Surveillance
- Antenatal testing for insulin-requiring GDM starting 32 weeks
- Ultrasound for fetal growth assessment

### Delivery Timing
- Well-controlled GDM without complications: 39-40 weeks
- GDM requiring medication: 39 0/7 - 39 6/7 weeks
- Poor glycemic control: Individualized decision (may be earlier)

### Postpartum
- Postpartum OGTT at 4-12 weeks
- Lifestyle counseling for diabetes prevention
- Contraception counseling
