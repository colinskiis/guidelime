## Scope

This consult provides guidance on risk assessment, prevention, and management of preeclampsia and related hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.

## Key Recommendations

### Risk Factors
**High Risk:**
- Prior preeclampsia
- Chronic hypertension
- Type 1 or 2 diabetes
- Chronic kidney disease
- Autoimmune disease (SLE, antiphospholipid syndrome)
- Multiple gestation

**Moderate Risk:**
- Nulliparity
- BMI >30
- Family history of preeclampsia
- Advanced maternal age (≥35)
- Prior adverse pregnancy outcomes

### Aspirin Prophylaxis
- Low-dose aspirin 81-162 mg daily
- Start at 12-16 weeks, before 16 weeks optimal
- Continue until delivery
- Recommended for ≥1 high-risk factor OR ≥2 moderate-risk factors

### Diagnosis
- BP ≥140/90 on 2 occasions after 20 weeks
- Proteinuria OR end-organ dysfunction:
  - Thrombocytopenia (<100,000)
  - Elevated creatinine (>1.1)
  - Elevated transaminases (>2x ULN)
  - Pulmonary edema
  - Cerebral or visual symptoms

### Management
**Antihypertensives for Severe Hypertension (≥160/110):**
- IV labetalol
- IV hydralazine
- Oral nifedipine (immediate release)
- Treat within 30-60 minutes

**Magnesium Sulfate:**
- For seizure prophylaxis in severe features
- Loading: 4-6g IV; Maintenance: 1-2g/hr

### Delivery Timing
- <34 weeks with severe features: Individualize with corticosteroids
- 34-36+6 weeks with severe features: Delivery recommended
- ≥37 weeks with preeclampsia: Delivery recommended
