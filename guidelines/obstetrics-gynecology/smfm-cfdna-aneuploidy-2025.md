## Scope
Updated evidence-based guidance from the SMFM on the use of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) screening for fetal aneuploidy, replacing or refining previous versions to reflect improved technology and clinical data.

## Key Recommendations

### Universal Offering
- **Recommendation**: cfDNA screening for common trisomies (21, 18, and 13) should be offered to all pregnant individuals, regardless of age or baseline risk.
- **Timing**: Can be performed as early as 10 weeks of gestation.

### Pre-test Counseling
- **Elements**: Counseling should include the benefits (high sensitivity/specificity), limitations (false positives/negatives, nonreporting), and the difference between a screening test and a diagnostic test (e.g., CVS or amniocentesis).
- **Incidental Findings**: Patients should be informed that cfDNA may incidentally detect maternal conditions (e.g., maternal aneuploidy, occult malignancy).

### Management of Nonreported Results ("No-Calls")
- **Risk Assessment**: A nonreported cfDNA result is associated with an increased risk of fetal aneuploidy (especially trisomy 13, 18, and triploidy) and fetal growth restriction.
- **Next Steps**: Offer detailed ultrasound evaluation and diagnostic testing. Repeat cfDNA is generally not recommended as the primary next step if the failure was due to low fetal fraction.

### Screening for Microdeletions and Sex Chromosome Aneuploidies (SCA)
- **SCA**: Screening for sex chromosome aneuploidies is generally supported but requires specific counseling regarding the variable phenotype and higher false-positive rates compared to trisomy 21.
- **Microdeletions**: Continued caution or "informed choice" for microdeletion screening (e.g., 22q11.2 deletion syndrome) due to lower positive predictive values (PPV).

### Clinical Considerations
- **Twin Gestations**: cfDNA is a highly effective screening tool for twin gestations, though fetal fraction evaluation is more complex.
- **Obesity**: High maternal BMI reduces the fetal fraction; patients should be counseled on the higher risk of a "no-call" result.
- **Confirmation**: Any positive cfDNA screening result should be confirmed by a diagnostic procedure (CVS or amniocentesis) before making irreversible pregnancy management decisions.
