## Scope
Transformative 2025 guideline advocating for a move away from the traditional fixed prenatal visit schedule (e.g., the 12-14 visit model) toward a personalized, risk-based approach that addresses individual medical, social, and structural needs.

## Key Recommendations

### Shift to Personalized Scheduling
- **Risk Assessment**: Every pregnant individual should have a comprehensive initial risk assessment to determine the appropriate frequency and mode of prenatal visits.
- **Flexibility**: For low-risk pregnancies, a reduced number of in-person visits combined with telehealth and remote monitoring (e.g., for blood pressure and weight) is an acceptable and often preferred option.
- **High-Risk**: Patients with higher medical or social risk require more frequent and potentially more specialized monitoring.

### Modes of Care Delivery
- **Telemedicine**: Recommends the integration of telemedicine for specific encounter types (e.g., initial consultation, mental health screening, or review of lab results) to improve access and reduce barriers like transportation.
- **Group Prenatal Care**: Recommends offering group prenatal care (e.g., CenteringPregnancy) as an evidence-based model that improves patient engagement and some clinical outcomes.

### Addressing Social Determinants of Health (SDOH)
- **Screening**: Routine screening for unmet social needs (e.g., food insecurity, housing instability, interpersonal violence) is mandatory at the first visit and periodically thereafter.
- **Action**: Clinicians should have pathways to refer patients to appropriate community resources to address identified social needs.

### Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM)
- **Blood Pressure**: Encourages the use of validated home blood pressure monitors for all patients, with specific protocols for reporting and responding to elevated readings to detect hypertensive disorders of pregnancy early.

### Mental Health and Support
- **Screening**: Universal screening for perinatal depression and anxiety should occur multiple times during the prenatal and postpartum periods.
- **Continuity**: Emphasizes the importance of continuity of caregiver to build trust and improve the quality of care.

### Operational Implementation
- Clinics should review their workflows and billing models to support these flexible, multidisciplinary care delivery structures.
