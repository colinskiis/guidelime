## Scope
Evidence-based recommendations for diagnosis, evaluation, and management of fetal growth restriction (FGR). Replaces SMFM Clinical Guideline #3 from April 2012.

## Key Recommendations

### Terminology
- **Use "fetal growth restriction" (FGR)** instead of "intrauterine growth restriction" (IUGR)
- FGR defined as sonographic EFW or AC <10th percentile for gestational age

### Diagnosis (GRADE 1B)
- **Definition**: EFW or abdominal circumference (AC) below 10th percentile for gestational age
- Use **population-based fetal growth references** (e.g., Hadlock)
- Severe FGR: EFW <3rd percentile

### Evaluation
- **Detailed anatomy ultrasound**: Assess for structural anomalies
- **Uterine artery Doppler**: Assess placental function
- **Umbilical artery Doppler**: Primary surveillance tool
- Consider genetic testing (amniocentesis, microarray) especially if:
  - Early-onset FGR
  - Severe FGR
  - Associated anomalies
  - Polyhydramnios
- Evaluate for maternal causes (hypertension, autoimmune disease, thrombophilia)

### Surveillance

#### Umbilical Artery Doppler Categories
- **Normal**: Continue serial growth and Doppler
- **Elevated S/D ratio (>95th percentile)**: Increased surveillance frequency
- **Absent end-diastolic flow (AEDF)**: Consider hospitalization, antenatal steroids, delivery planning
- **Reversed end-diastolic flow (REDF)**: High risk of fetal demise, consider delivery if viable

#### Additional Doppler Assessments
- **Middle cerebral artery (MCA)**: Assess brain-sparing
- **Ductus venosus**: Assess cardiac function (particularly in early-onset FGR)

#### Fetal Testing
- NST/BPP as adjunctive surveillance
- Frequency based on severity and gestational age

### Timing of Delivery

| Condition | Recommended Delivery Timing |
|-----------|----------------------------|
| FGR with normal Doppler | 38-39 weeks |
| Elevated umbilical artery Doppler | 37-38 weeks |
| Absent end-diastolic flow | 33-34 weeks (with steroids) |
| Reversed end-diastolic flow | 30-32 weeks (with steroids) |
| Abnormal ductus venosus | Individualize, often 30-32 weeks |

### Antenatal Corticosteroids
- Administer if delivery anticipated before 34 weeks
- Consider for late preterm (34-36 weeks) if not previously given

### Mode of Delivery
- FGR alone is not an indication for cesarean delivery
- Continuous fetal monitoring during labor recommended
- Lower threshold for cesarean if fetal intolerance to labor
