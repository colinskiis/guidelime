## Scope
2024 ACOG practice bulletin on counseling, patient selection, and management for vaginal birth after cesarean delivery (VBAC).

## Key Recommendations

### Terminology
- **TOLAC (Trial of Labor After Cesarean)**: Attempting vaginal delivery.
- **VBAC (Vaginal Birth After Cesarean)**: Successful vaginal delivery after TOLAC.

### Eligibility
- Most patients with one prior low transverse cesarean delivery are candidates for TOLAC.
- **Contraindications**: Prior classical or T-incision, prior uterine rupture, certain uterine surgeries, placenta previa.

### Counseling and Shared Decision-Making
- Discuss benefits of VBAC (shorter recovery, lower infection risk, avoids multiple repeat cesareans) vs. risks (uterine rupture ~0.5-0.9% for one prior cesarean).
- Use VBAC prediction calculators (e.g., MFMU calculator) to estimate success likelihood (typically 60-80% for appropriately selected patients).

### Setting
- TOLAC should be attempted in facilities capable of emergent cesarean delivery.
- "Immediately available" surgical and anesthesia capability is recommended by ACOG, though individualized risk-benefit may allow TOLAC in hospitals with emergency cesarean capability within 30 minutes.

### Labor Management
- Spontaneous labor onset is associated with higher VBAC success.
- **Induction**: May be offered; prostaglandins (especially misoprostol for cervical ripening) are generally avoided due to increased uterine rupture risk. Mechanical methods (Foley balloon) and oxytocin are acceptable.
- Continuous fetal monitoring.

### Uterine Rupture
- Monitor for signs: sudden fetal heart rate abnormalities (most common), maternal abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, loss of fetal station.
- Immediate cesarean delivery if suspected.

### Multiple Prior Cesareans
- TOLAC may still be offered to patients with two prior low transverse cesareans after careful counseling; success rates slightly lower, rupture risk slightly higher.
