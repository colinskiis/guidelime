# ACOG Practice Bulletin: Postpartum Hemorrhage

## Metadata
- **Specialty**: Obstetrics and Gynecology
- **Organization**: American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG)
- **Year**: 2017 (Practice Bulletin No. 183, with 2025 Clinical Practice Update)
- **Source URL**: https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/practice-bulletin/articles/2017/10/postpartum-hemorrhage

## Scope
Risk assessment, prevention, and management of postpartum hemorrhage (PPH), the leading cause of severe maternal morbidity in the United States.

## Key Definitions

- **Primary PPH**: Cumulative blood loss ≥1,000 mL OR blood loss with signs/symptoms of hypovolemia within 24 hours of delivery
- **Secondary PPH**: Significant bleeding >24 hours to 12 weeks postpartum

## Risk Factors

### Antepartum
- Prior PPH
- Placenta previa, accreta spectrum
- Multiple gestation
- Polyhydramnios
- Macrosomia
- Grand multiparity
- Coagulation disorders

### Intrapartum
- Prolonged labor
- Augmented labor
- Rapid labor
- Operative vaginal delivery
- Cesarean delivery
- Chorioamnionitis
- Magnesium sulfate use

## Prevention

### Active Management of Third Stage (AMTSL)
1. **Uterotonic administration** immediately after delivery
2. **Uterine massage** after placental delivery
3. **Controlled cord traction** (optional)

### Prophylactic Uterotonics
- **Oxytocin**: 10-40 units IV in dilute solution (first-line)
- **Carbetocin**: Single-dose alternative (where available)
- **Tranexamic acid**: Consider prophylactically for high-risk patients

## Management Algorithm

### Step 1: Initial Measures
- Quantitative blood loss assessment
- Bimanual uterine massage
- IV access, labs (CBC, coagulation studies, type & screen)
- Uterotonic medications

### Step 2: First-Line Uterotonics
| Agent | Dose | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| Oxytocin | 10-40 units IV | First-line |
| Methylergonovine | 0.2 mg IM | Avoid in hypertension |
| Carboprost (15-methyl PGF2α) | 0.25 mg IM | Avoid in asthma |
| Misoprostol | 600-1000 mcg SL/rectal | Alternative |

### Step 3: Second-Line Interventions
- **Tranexamic acid**: 1g IV within 3 hours of delivery (reduces mortality)
- **Uterine tamponade**: Balloon tamponade or vacuum-induced device
- **Uterine compression sutures**: B-Lynch, others

### Step 4: Surgical/Interventional
- Uterine artery ligation
- Internal iliac artery ligation
- Uterine artery embolization
- Hysterectomy (life-saving, definitive)

## Transfusion

### Massive Transfusion Protocol
- Activate early if ongoing hemorrhage
- Target 1:1:1 ratio (RBC:FFP:platelets)
- Consider cryoprecipitate for fibrinogen <200 mg/dL

### Tranexamic Acid
- 1g IV over 10 minutes
- Administer within 3 hours of delivery
- May repeat once if bleeding continues

## 2025 Update: Nonsurgical Hemorrhage-Control Devices
- Hospitals should have access to uterine balloon tamponade OR intrauterine vacuum-induced hemorrhage-control devices
- Part of comprehensive PPH management algorithm
- Jada system and Bakri balloon are examples

## Key Points
- Hemorrhage leading to transfusion is #1 cause of severe maternal morbidity in US
- Early recognition and intervention critical
- Multidisciplinary response team essential
- Quantitative blood loss measurement recommended
