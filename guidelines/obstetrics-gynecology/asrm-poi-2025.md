## Scope
First comprehensive, evidence-based ASRM guideline for the diagnosis, counseling, and long-term management of women and girls with Premature Ovarian Insufficiency (POI).

## Key Recommendations

### Diagnosis
- **Definition**: POI is defined as hypergonadotropic hypogonadism before the age of 40, characterized by amenorrhea (for ≥4 months) and elevated FSH (≥25 IU/L on two occasions at least 4 weeks apart).
- **Distinction**: POI should be distinguished from "low ovarian reserve," which may occur without overt ovarian failure.

### Etiological Workup
- **Karyotype**: Recommended for all women with idiopathic or unexplained POI to rule out Turner syndrome variants and other X-chromosome abnormalities.
- **Genetic Testing**: Consider testing for FMR1 premutation (fragile X carrier status), as it is a common cause of genetic POI and has implications for cognitive health and family planning.
- **Autoimmune Screening**: Screen for adrenal antibodies (21-hydroxylase antibodies) given the association between POI and autoimmune adrenal insufficiency.

### Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT)
- **HRT is Mandatory**: HRT is strongly recommended until the average age of natural menopause (~50-51 years) to prevent adverse long-term consequences (osteoporosis, CVD, cognitive decline).
- **Regimen**: Transdermal estradiol combined with micronized progesterone is often preferred.
- **Bone Health**: DEXA screening is recommended at diagnosis.

### Fertility Counseling
- **Spontaneous Conception**: Patients should be counseled that pregnancy sometimes occurs spontaneously (~5-10% lifetime chance).
- **Oocyte Donation**: Oocyte donation is the most reliable fertility option for women with established POI.
- **Emerging Options**: Discuss future possibilities of ovarian tissue cryopreservation and in-vitro activation, though these remain largely investigational.

### Psychosocial Support
- **Importance**: The diagnosis of POI is psychologically significant. Referral to psychological support, counseling, and peer support groups is strongly recommended.
