## Scope
Comprehensive evidence-based recommendations for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of infertility in individuals and couples.

## Key Recommendations

### Definition and Diagnosis
- **Clinical Definition**: Failure to achieve a pregnancy after 12 months or more of regular unprotected sexual intercourse.
- **Earlier Evaluation**: Consider earlier evaluation (e.g., after 6 months) for:
  - Women aged >35 years
  - Known risk factors (e.g., endometriosis, history of PID, known male factor)

### Prevention
- **STI Management**: Emphasis on prevention and prompt treatment of sexually transmitted infections to prevent tubal factor infertility.
- **Lifestyle Factors**: Addressing smoking, excessive alcohol, and environmental exposures.

### Diagnostic Workup
- **Semen Analysis**: First-line evaluation for the male partner.
- **Ovulation Assessment**: Documenting regular cycles or using hormonal testing.
- **Tubal Patency**: Assessing via HSG or laparoscopy where indicated.
- **Ovarian Reserve**: Evaluation for women, especially with advanced maternal age.

### Treatment Options
- **Ovulation Induction**: For women with anovulatory infertility (e.g., PCOS).
- **Intrauterine Insemination (IUI)**: For mild male factor or unexplained infertility.
- **Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART)**: IVF/ICSI recommendations for moderate-to-severe male factor, bilateral tubal obstruction, or failed conservative measures.
- **Surgery**: Laparoscopic treatment for endometriosis or tubal repair.

### Psychosocial Support
- **Integration of Care**: Psychosocial support should be integrated into the standard infertility care pathway.
- **Address Stigma**: Recommendations for reducing the social stigma associated with infertility.

### Global Access
- **Affordability**: Encourages governments to include infertility care in Universal Health Coverage (UHC) packages.
- **Standardized Reporting**: Use of standardized terminology for reporting outcomes.
