## Scope
Updated evidence-based recommendations on how to use contraceptive methods safely and effectively once they are deemed medically appropriate.

## Key Recommendations

### Initiation of Methods
- **Timing of Initiation**: Most methods can be started at any time if it is reasonably certain the woman is not pregnant.
- **Quick-Start Approach**: Recommends starting contraception immediately ("Quick-Start") rather than waiting for the next menses, provided pregnancy can be reasonably excluded.

### Management of Missed Doses
- **Combined Oral Contraceptives (COCs)**: Updated protocols for missed pills based on how many pills are missed and when in the cycle.
- **Progestogen-Only Pills (POPs)**: Specific time windows (e.g., 3-hour or 12-hour depending on agent) for "missed" pills.

### Managing Side Effects
- **Irregular Bleeding**: Guidance on managing unscheduled spotting/bleeding, which is common with long-acting reversible contraception (LARC).
- **Amenorrhea**: Reassurance for women using methods that lead to amenorrhea (e.g., hormonal IUDs, implants).

### Follow-up and Continuation
- **Routine Follow-up**: Not required for many methods; focus should be on meeting the patient's needs for information or changes.
- **Switching Methods**: Guidance on how to switch between different hormonal methods without a gap in protection.

### Specific Method Guidance
- **Emergency Contraception**: Updated recommendations on the timing and efficacy of levonorgestrel vs. ulipristal acetate.
- **IUD Placement**: Clarifications on timing of placement (including postpartum and post-abortion).
- **Male and Female Sterilization**: Counseling and timing recommendations.

### Medical Eligibility Criteria (MEC) Integration
- This guideline should be used in conjunction with the **WHO Medical Eligibility Criteria (MEC) 6th Edition (2025)** for Determining safety.
