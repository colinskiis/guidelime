## Scope
2024 ACOG practice bulletin on the diagnosis and management of cervical insufficiency, including the role of cerclage and progesterone.

## Key Recommendations

### Definition
- Cervical insufficiency: Painless cervical dilation and/or shortening leading to recurrent second-trimester pregnancy loss or spontaneous preterm birth in the absence of labor, bleeding, or infection.

### Risk Factors
- History of second-trimester loss or preterm birth.
- Prior cervical surgery (cone biopsy, LEEP).
- Uterine anomalies.
- Multiple gestations.

### Diagnosis
- **Clinical Diagnosis of Exclusion**: Based on history of painless cervical dilation and/or recurrent mid-trimester loss.
- **Transvaginal Ultrasound (TVUS)**: Cervical length <25 mm before 24 weeks is short cervix.

### Management Strategies

#### History-Indicated Cerclage
- Offer to women with history of ≥1 second-trimester loss or preterm birth due to painless cervical dilation.
- Placed at 12-14 weeks; removed at 36-37 weeks.

#### Ultrasound-Indicated Cerclage
- For women with prior spontaneous preterm birth AND short cervix (<25 mm) detected on serial TVUS before 24 weeks.
- Consider in singleton pregnancies.

#### Physical Exam-Indicated (Rescue) Cerclage
- For women with cervical dilation ≤4 cm and visible membranes before 24 weeks, without labor, infection, or bleeding. Higher risk of complications.

### Progesterone
- **Vaginal Progesterone**: Recommended for women with short cervix (<25 mm) on ultrasound AND no prior preterm birth.
- **17-OHPC (17-alpha-hydroxyprogesterone caproate)**: Previously used for history of preterm birth; recent trials show less benefit. Individualized discussion.

### Cervical Pessary
- Limited evidence; not routinely recommended.

### Multiple Gestations
- Cerclage is generally NOT recommended for short cervix in twins (may increase preterm birth risk). Vaginal progesterone may be considered.
