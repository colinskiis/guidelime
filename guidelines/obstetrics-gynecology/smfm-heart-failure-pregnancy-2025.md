## Scope
2025 SMFM consult providing expert recommendations for the diagnosis and management of heart failure in pregnancy and the postpartum period, with a focus on peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM).

## Key Recommendations

### Diagnosis
- **Heart Failure Symptoms**: Dyspnea, edema, and orthopnea are common in normal pregnancy. Maintain a high index of suspicion for HF when symptoms are severe, progressive, or out of proportion to the stage of pregnancy.
- **BNP/NT-proBNP**: Levels rise in normal pregnancy but can be useful if markedly elevated to support a diagnosis of HF.
- **Echocardiography**: The gold standard for diagnosis. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <45% is diagnostic for PPCM.

### Peripartum Cardiomyopathy (PPCM)
- **Definition**: HF presenting in the last month of pregnancy or within 5 months postpartum in the absence of another cause.
- **Risk Factors**: Advanced maternal age, multiparity, multifetal gestation, preeclampsia, and Black race.

### Medical Management
- **Diuretics**: Use judiciously to manage volume overload while monitoring fetal well-being.
- **Beta-blockers**: Metoprolol succinate or bisoprolol are preferred for rate/rhythm control and HFrEF management.
- **Hydralazine/Nitrates**: May be used for afterload reduction in pregnancy, as ACE inhibitors/ARBs are contraindicated.
- **Bromocriptine**: Consider as adjunctive therapy for PPCM, particularly in early postpartum, based on evidence of improved LV recovery.

### Postpartum Management
- **Transition to Standard HFrEF Therapy**: After delivery, initiate ACE inhibitors (or ARBs), beta-blockers, MRAs, and SGLT2 inhibitors as tolerated.
- **Anticoagulation**: Consider for patients with severely reduced LVEF (<30–35%) to prevent LV thrombus.

### Breastfeeding
- Most standard HF medications are compatible with breastfeeding. Discuss risks and benefits with the patient.

### Preconception Counseling for Future Pregnancies
- Counsel that subsequent pregnancies carry a risk of HF recurrence, particularly if LVEF has not fully recovered.
- LVEF <50-55% at the time of conception is associated with significantly higher risk of maternal morbidity.
