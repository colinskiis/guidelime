## Scope
2024 ACOG practice bulletin on the management of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) during pregnancy.

## Key Recommendations

### Diagnosis (Covered in ACOG GDM Screening Guideline)
- Screen all pregnant patients at 24-28 weeks with 1-step 75g OGTT or 2-step (50g GCT followed by 100g OGTT if positive).
- Early screening for patients with risk factors.

### Glycemic Targets
- **Fasting Glucose**: <95 mg/dL.
- **1-Hour Postprandial**: <140 mg/dL.
- **2-Hour Postprandial**: <120 mg/dL.
- Individualize based on hypoglycemia risk.

### First-Line Management
- **Medical Nutrition Therapy (MNT)**: Dietary counseling by a registered dietitian. Carbohydrate-controlled diet.
- **Physical Activity**: Moderate exercise (e.g., 30 min walking most days) if no contraindications.
- **Glucose Monitoring**: Daily self-monitoring of blood glucose (fasting + 1 or 2 hour postprandial).

### Pharmacologic Therapy (If Glycemic Targets Not Met After 1-2 Weeks)
- **Insulin (Preferred)**: Does not cross placenta. Rapid-acting analogs (lispro, aspart) and NPH or long-acting (detemir) are commonly used.
- **Metformin / Glyburide**: May be considered if patient declines or cannot use insulin. Both cross the placenta; long-term offspring effects under investigation. Metformin may have advantages but is less effective than insulin.

### Fetal Surveillance
- **Ultrasound**: Monitor fetal growth; assess for macrosomia or growth restriction.
- **Antenatal Testing**: Consider NST/BPP in third trimester, especially for insulin-requiring GDM or poor glycemic control.

### Timing of Delivery
- Well-controlled, diet-managed GDM: Expectant management to 40+6 weeks; delivery by 41 weeks.
- Medication-controlled GDM: Delivery 39+0 to 39+6 weeks.
- Poorly controlled or other complications: Individualize, may be earlier.

### Postpartum
- Screen for persistent diabetes at 4-12 weeks postpartum with 75g OGTT.
- Lifelong screening for type 2 diabetes every 1-3 years (GDM is a risk factor).
