## Scope
Global consensus statement outlining a paradigm shift in the management of chronic pelvic pain (CPP), emphasizing a holistic, biopsychosocial approach and the need for multi-disciplinary care.

## Key Recommendations

### Definition and Framework
- **Definition**: CPP is defined as non-cyclical pain of at least 6 months duration that is perceived to be in the pelvic area and has a significant impact on quality of life.
- **Biopsychosocial Model**: Management must move beyond looking for a single structural cause (e.g., just endometriosis) to addressing physiological, psychological, and social contributors.

### Comprehensive Assessment
- **Pain Mapping**: Use of detailed pain maps and history to identify all potential drivers (gastrointestinal, urological, musculoskeletal, neurological, and gynecological).
- **Physical Exam**: Includes evaluation of the abdominal wall, pelvic floor musculature (trigger points), and pelvic nerves, in addition to the standard bimanual exam.
- **Screening for Central Sensitization**: Recognize that long-standing pain can lead to changes in the central nervous system ("nociplastic pain").

### Multi-disciplinary Management
- **The Core Team**: Should ideally include:
  - Gynecologist with expertise in pain.
  - Pelvic Floor Physical Therapist (highly recommended for nearly all patients).
  - Pain-informed Mental Health Specialist (e.g., for CBT or ACT).
  - Pain Specialist or Anesthesiologist.
- **Patient at the Center**: Patients should be partners in the care plan, with a focus on functional goals rather than just "zero pain."

### Treatment Strategies
- **Endometriosis Management**: Medical management (hormonal suppression) is first-line. Surgery (excision) should be reserved for specific cases and performed by specialists, but it may not resolve all pain if other drivers (e.g., pelvic floor tension) are present.
- **Pelvic Floor Physical Therapy (PFPT)**: Essential for addressing myofascial pain and muscular dysfunction.
- **Pharmacotherapy**: Use of neuromodulators (e.g., gabapentinoids, SNRIs) as adjuncts for central sensitization.
- **Integrative Approaches**: Support for mindfulness, yoga, and dietary changes where indicated.

### Global Advocacy
- **Education**: Call for increased education for all primary care and gynecological providers on the basics of pain science.
- **Research**: Prioritize research into the mechanisms of CPP and the efficacy of multi-disciplinary interventions.
- **Access**: Work towards global equity in access to specialized pelvic pain services.
