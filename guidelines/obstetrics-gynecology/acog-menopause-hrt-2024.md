## Scope
2024 ACOG practice bulletin on the evaluation and management of menopausal symptoms, including hormone and non-hormonal therapies.

## Key Recommendations

### Vasomotor Symptoms (VMS)
- **Most Effective Treatment**: Systemic hormone therapy (HT) – estrogen alone (for women without a uterus) or estrogen + progestogen (with uterus).
- **Timing**: Initiate within 10 years of menopause onset or before age 60 for favorable benefit-risk profile.
- **Lowest Effective Dose**: Use lowest dose for shortest duration that meets treatment goals; reassess periodically.

### Hormone Therapy Formulations
- **Estrogen**: Oral (conjugated estrogen, estradiol), transdermal (patch, gel, spray). Transdermal may have lower VTE risk.
- **Progestogen**: Oral (micronized progesterone, medroxyprogesterone), transdermal, IUD (levonorgestrel). Micronized progesterone may have better safety profile.

### Contraindications to Systemic HT
- Unexplained vaginal bleeding, history of breast cancer, history of estrogen-sensitive cancer, active liver disease, history of VTE or thromboembolic disorder, CHD, stroke.

### Non-Hormonal Options for VMS
- **SSRIs/SNRIs**: Paroxetine (only FDA-approved non-hormonal for VMS), escitalopram, venlafaxine, desvenlafaxine.
- **Gabapentin, Pregabalin**: Moderate efficacy for VMS.
- **Fezolinetant (Veozah)**: NK3 receptor antagonist. FDA-approved for moderate-to-severe VMS.
- **Oxybutynin**: May reduce VMS; limited data.
- **Lifestyle**: Weight loss, layer clothing, avoid triggers (caffeine, alcohol, spicy foods), acupuncture (modest benefit).

### Genitourinary Syndrome of Menopause (GSM)
- **Low-Dose Vaginal Estrogen**: First-line for vaginal dryness, dyspareunia, urinary symptoms. Minimal systemic absorption; safe for most women (including many breast cancer survivors – individualize).
- **Ospemifene, DHEA (Prasterone)**: Alternatives.
- **Lubricants and Moisturizers**: For mild symptoms or adjunct.

### Monitoring
- Reassess HT annually; discuss continuing vs. tapering based on symptoms and risks.
