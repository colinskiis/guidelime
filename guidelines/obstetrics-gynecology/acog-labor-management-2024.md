## Scope
Evidence-based recommendations for defining labor stages and managing dystocia in the first and second stages of labor.

## Key Recommendations

### Definitions

#### First Stage of Labor
| Phase | Definition |
|-------|------------|
| Latent phase | Onset of labor to 6 cm dilation |
| Active phase | 6 cm to complete dilation (10 cm) |

#### Second Stage of Labor
- From complete cervical dilation to delivery of the infant

### Diagnosis of Labor

#### Active Labor
- Regular, painful contractions
- Cervical change (dilation and effacement)
- Active phase begins at **6 cm dilation**

#### Latent Phase Duration
- Highly variable
- Can exceed 20 hours in nulliparas
- Slow latent phase is NOT an indication for cesarean

### First Stage Management

#### Active Phase Progress
| Parity | Expected Dilation Rate |
|--------|----------------------|
| Nulliparous | ≥0.5 cm/hour (at minimum) |
| Multiparous | ≥0.5-0.7 cm/hour |

- Slower rates are common and not necessarily abnormal
- Avoid diagnosing arrest too early

#### First Stage Arrest
Diagnose arrest ONLY if:
- Cervix ≥6 cm
- Membranes ruptured
- Adequate contractions for ≥4 hours OR
- Oxytocin augmentation with inadequate contractions for ≥6 hours

### Induction of Labor

#### Unsuccessful Induction
- Oxytocin administered for **minimum 12-18 hours** after membrane rupture
- Before deeming induction unsuccessful
- Allow adequate time for cervical ripening

#### Cervical Ripening Methods
| Method | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| Prostaglandin E2 (dinoprostone) | Vaginal insert or gel |
| Prostaglandin E1 (misoprostol) | Vaginal or oral |
| Mechanical (balloon catheter) | Foley or double balloon |
| Combination | May combine methods |

### Second Stage Management

#### Expected Duration
| Parity | Without Epidural | With Epidural |
|--------|------------------|---------------|
| Nulliparous | Up to 2 hours | Up to 3 hours |
| Multiparous | Up to 1 hour | Up to 2 hours |

- Longer durations may be acceptable with progress

#### Second Stage Arrest
- Diagnose if:
  - ≥3 hours in nulliparous women (with epidural)
  - ≥2 hours in multiparous women (with epidural)
  - No progress in descent or rotation

#### Pushing Techniques
- Delayed pushing may be considered with epidural
- Spontaneous pushing vs. coached pushing
- Position changes to facilitate descent

### Oxytocin Use

#### Augmentation Protocol
- Start at low dose (1-2 mU/min)
- Increase incrementally (every 15-40 minutes)
- Target: Adequate contractions (3-5 per 10 minutes)

#### Monitoring
- Continuous fetal heart rate monitoring
- Uterine activity assessment
- Maternal vital signs

### Operative Vaginal Delivery

#### Indications
- Prolonged second stage
- Maternal exhaustion
- Non-reassuring fetal status

#### Requirements
- Fully dilated cervix
- Engaged head
- Known position
- Adequate anesthesia
- Informed consent

### Cesarean Delivery

#### Avoid Cesarean for
- Latent phase dystocia alone
- Slow but progressive active phase
- Failure to wait adequate time after induction

#### Indications for Cesarean
- Failed induction (after adequate trial)
- First stage arrest (meeting criteria)
- Second stage arrest (after adequate pushing)
- Non-reassuring fetal status

### Safe Reduction of Primary Cesarean

#### Key Strategies
- Patience in latent phase
- Allow adequate time in active phase
- Use 6 cm as active phase threshold
- Allow adequate oxytocin time after rupture
- Consider operative vaginal delivery

### Monitoring and Documentation
- Partograph or labor curve
- Cervical exams every 2-4 hours
- Fetal status assessment
- Response to interventions
