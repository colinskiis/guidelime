## Scope
Updated recommendations for screening for pregestational and gestational diabetes in pregnancy and postpartum testing in patients with GDM.

## Key Recommendations

### Screening for Pregestational Diabetes

#### Early Pregnancy Screening (Targeted)
- Screen patients with **risk factors** before 24 weeks
- Preferably at onset of prenatal care
- Use standard diagnostic criteria for diabetes

#### Risk Factors for Early Screening
| Risk Factor |
|-------------|
| BMI ≥25 kg/m² (≥23 in Asian Americans) |
| Previous GDM |
| Prior macrosomic infant |
| Family history of diabetes (first-degree relative) |
| High-risk ethnicity |
| History of PCOS |
| Prediabetes (A1c 5.7-6.4%) |
| Cardiovascular disease history |
| Hypertension |

#### Diagnostic Criteria for Pregestational Diabetes
| Test | Threshold |
|------|-----------|
| Fasting glucose | ≥126 mg/dL |
| HbA1c | ≥6.5% |
| 2-hour 75g OGTT | ≥200 mg/dL |
| Random glucose with symptoms | ≥200 mg/dL |

### Key Changes from Previous Guidance
- No longer recommends screening for early GDM
- Continues targeted (not universal) early screening for pregestational diabetes
- Updated postpartum testing recommendations

### Screening for Gestational Diabetes

#### Universal Screening at 24-28 Weeks
All pregnant persons without pregestational diabetes should be screened

#### Two-Step Approach (Preferred in US)
**Step 1: 50g Glucose Challenge Test (GCT)**
- Non-fasting
- Abnormal if 1-hour glucose ≥130-140 mg/dL (threshold varies by institution)

**Step 2: 100g OGTT (if GCT abnormal)**
| Time | Carpenter-Coustan | NDDG |
|------|------------------|------|
| Fasting | ≥95 mg/dL | ≥105 mg/dL |
| 1-hour | ≥180 mg/dL | ≥190 mg/dL |
| 2-hour | ≥155 mg/dL | ≥165 mg/dL |
| 3-hour | ≥140 mg/dL | ≥145 mg/dL |

- GDM diagnosed if **≥2 values** are met or exceeded

#### One-Step Approach (Alternative)
**75g OGTT (fasting)**
| Time | Threshold |
|------|-----------|
| Fasting | ≥92 mg/dL |
| 1-hour | ≥180 mg/dL |
| 2-hour | ≥153 mg/dL |

- GDM diagnosed if **≥1 value** is met or exceeded

### Management of GDM
- Nutritional counseling
- Blood glucose monitoring
- Medical nutrition therapy
- Pharmacotherapy if targets not met (insulin or metformin)

#### Glucose Targets in GDM
| Timing | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Fasting | <95 mg/dL |
| 1-hour postprandial | <140 mg/dL |
| 2-hour postprandial | <120 mg/dL |

### Postpartum Testing

#### Updated Recommendations
- Screen for persistent diabetes **4-12 weeks postpartum**
- Use 75g OGTT (preferred) or fasting glucose
- HbA1c may be used but less sensitive early postpartum

#### Interpretation of Postpartum OGTT
| Result | Fasting | 2-hour |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Normal | <100 mg/dL | <140 mg/dL |
| Impaired fasting glucose | 100-125 mg/dL | — |
| Impaired glucose tolerance | — | 140-199 mg/dL |
| Diabetes | ≥126 mg/dL | ≥200 mg/dL |

### Long-Term Follow-Up
- Patients with GDM have increased lifetime risk of type 2 diabetes
- Screen for diabetes every 1-3 years lifelong
- Lifestyle modification counseling
- Preconception counseling for future pregnancies

### Future Pregnancies
- Early screening in subsequent pregnancies
- History of GDM is risk factor for recurrence
- Optimize weight between pregnancies
