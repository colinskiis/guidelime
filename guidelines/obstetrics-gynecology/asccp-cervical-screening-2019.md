## Scope
Risk-based consensus guidelines for management of abnormal cervical cancer screening results and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, replacing algorithm-based approaches.

## Key Principles

### Risk-Based Management
- Management based on **estimated risk of CIN 3+** rather than specific test results
- Uses clinical action thresholds to determine next steps
- Incorporates current AND prior screening history

### Clinical Action Thresholds

| CIN 3+ Risk | Recommended Action |
|-------------|-------------------|
| ≥4.0% | Colposcopy recommended |
| ≥25% | Treatment OR colposcopy with biopsy |
| ≥60% | Treatment preferred over observation |
| <4.0% | Surveillance (timing based on risk) |
| <0.55% | Return to routine screening at 5 years |

## Management by Screening Result

### ASCUS (Atypical Squamous Cells of Undetermined Significance)

#### HPV-Positive ASCUS
- **Colposcopy recommended** (immediate risk ≥4%)
- Reflex HPV testing acceptable approach

#### HPV-Negative ASCUS
- Repeat co-testing in 3 years
- Lower risk warrants surveillance

### LSIL (Low-Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion)

#### HPV-Positive LSIL
- Colposcopy recommended
- Similar management to HPV+ ASCUS

#### HPV-Negative LSIL
- Repeat testing in 1 year
- Rare scenario (LSIL usually HPV-related)

### HSIL (High-Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion)
- Immediate colposcopy with biopsy
- Excisional treatment acceptable if no pregnancy
- Expedited treatment (LEEP) acceptable without prior biopsy if CIN 2+ expected

### ASC-H (Atypical Squamous Cells, Cannot Exclude HSIL)
- Colposcopy recommended
- Higher risk than ASCUS

### AGC (Atypical Glandular Cells)
- Colposcopy with endocervical sampling
- Endometrial sampling if ≥35 years or risk factors
- HPV testing if not already performed

## Importance of Prior Screening History

### Unknown History
- Manage based on current result alone
- Generally higher-risk assumptions

### Recent Negative HPV
- New abnormality after negative HPV within 5 years indicates **new infection**
- Approximately half the CIN 3+ risk vs unknown history
- May allow surveillance instead of immediate colposcopy

## Post-Colposcopy Management

### When Colposcopy Doesn't Identify CIN

| Initial Result | Recommended Follow-up |
|----------------|----------------------|
| HPV+ ASCUS or LSIL | Co-test at 12 months |
| HSIL | Diagnostic excision preferred |
| Persistent HPV+ ASCUS/LSIL | Consider excision or repeat colposcopy |

## Surveillance After Treatment

### After Treatment for CIN 2/3
- HPV-based testing at 6 months post-treatment
- If HPV negative: Annual testing for 3 years, then every 3 years for 25 years
- If HPV positive: Colposcopy recommended

## Special Populations
- **Pregnancy**: Colposcopy without biopsy acceptable; defer treatment
- **Immunocompromised**: Lower threshold for colposcopy
- **Age ≥65**: Consider patient history and life expectancy

## Key Updates from Previous Guidelines
- Risk-based approach replaces fixed algorithms
- Prior screening history incorporated into management
- Equal management options for certain equivalent-risk scenarios
