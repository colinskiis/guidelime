## Scope

This practice bulletin provides guidance on the prevention, recognition, and management of postpartum hemorrhage (PPH).

## Key Recommendations

### Definition
- Primary PPH: ≥1000 mL blood loss OR bleeding with signs of hypovolemia within 24 hours of delivery
- Replaces traditional ≥500 mL (vaginal) / ≥1000 mL (cesarean) definitions

### Risk Factors
- Uterine atony (most common cause)
- Retained placenta/products
- Uterine inversion
- Genital tract trauma
- Coagulopathy
- Placenta accreta spectrum

### Prevention
- Active management of third stage (oxytocin after delivery)
- Quantitative blood loss measurement
- Risk assessment and preparation
- Tranexamic acid prophylaxis in high-risk cases

### Initial Management (Stepwise Approach)
**Step 1 - Uterotonic Agents:**
- Oxytocin (first-line)
- Methylergonovine (avoid in HTN)
- Carboprost (avoid in asthma)
- Misoprostol (rectal/sublingual)

**Step 2 - Tamponade:**
- Uterine massage
- Intrauterine balloon tamponade
- Uterine packing

**Step 3 - Surgical Interventions:**
- B-Lynch or compression sutures
- Uterine artery ligation
- Hypogastric artery ligation
- Hysterectomy (life-saving)

### Transfusion
- Massive transfusion protocol activation when indicated
- Balanced resuscitation (1:1:1 RBC:FFP:platelets)
- Tranexamic acid within 3 hours of delivery

### Refractory Hemorrhage
- Interventional radiology (uterine artery embolization)
- Resuscitative hysterectomy if other measures fail
- Cell salvage when available
