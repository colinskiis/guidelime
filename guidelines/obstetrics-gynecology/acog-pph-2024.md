## Scope
2024 ACOG practice bulletin on the prevention, recognition, and management of postpartum hemorrhage (PPH).

## Key Recommendations

### Definition
- **Primary PPH**: Cumulative blood loss ≥1,000 mL or blood loss with signs/symptoms of hypovolemia within 24 hours of delivery.

### Risk Factors
- Prior PPH, prolonged labor, overdistended uterus (macrosomia, multiples, polyhydramnios), chorioamnionitis, operative vaginal delivery, cesarean delivery, placenta previa/accreta spectrum.

### Prevention
- **Active Management of Third Stage (AMTSL)**: Routine oxytocin (IM or IV) after delivery.
- **Tranexamic Acid (TXA)**: Consider prophylactically for high-risk patients.

### Management of PPH

#### First-Line (Uterine Atony – Most Common Cause)
- **Uterine Massage**.
- **Uterotonics**:
  - Oxytocin (continue/increase).
  - Methylergonovine (contraindicated in hypertension).
  - Carboprost (15-methyl PGF2α) – contraindicated in asthma.
  - Misoprostol (rectal/sublingual).

#### Second-Line
- **Tranexamic Acid (TXA)**: 1 g IV; give within 3 hours of delivery onset. Reduces death from bleeding.
- **Uterine Balloon Tamponade (Bakri Balloon)**: For atony refractory to uterotonics.
- **Uterine Compression Sutures (B-Lynch)**: Surgical option.
- **Uterine Artery Embolization**: If hemodynamically stable and interventional radiology available.

#### Refractory PPH
- **Hysterectomy**: Lifesaving for uncontrolled hemorrhage.

### Transfusion
- Massive transfusion protocol: 1:1:1 ratio of PRBCs, FFP, platelets.
- Monitor for coagulopathy (DIC).

### Quantitative Blood Loss (QBL)
- Measure blood loss objectively (weigh sponges/pads, calibrated drapes).
- QBL improves early recognition.

### Postpartum Care
- Monitor for delayed PPH (secondary PPH).
- Thromboprophylaxis after massive transfusion.
