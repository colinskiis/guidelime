## Scope
Updated 2025 ACOG clinical practice guideline for standardized interpretation and management of intrapartum electronic fetal heart rate (FHR) monitoring.

## Key Recommendations

### FHR Tracing Classification (NICHD 3-Tier System)
- **Category I (Normal)**: Baseline 110-160 bpm, moderate variability, accelerations present/absent, no late or variable decelerations. Strongly predictive of normal fetal acid-base status.
- **Category II (Indeterminate)**: Tracings that don't meet Category I or III criteria. Most common in labor. Requires ongoing evaluation and intervention as indicated.
- **Category III (Abnormal)**: Absent variability with recurrent late/variable decelerations, bradycardia, or sinusoidal pattern. Requires prompt evaluation and intervention.

### Management of Category II Tracings
- **Intrauterine Resuscitation Measures**:
  - Maternal repositioning (lateral).
  - IV fluid bolus.
  - Discontinue oxytocin if running.
  - Consider supplemental oxygen (though benefit is uncertain).
  - Correct hypotension (e.g., from epidural).
- **Assessment of Fetal Status**: Consider scalp or vibroacoustic stimulation. An acceleration in response is reassuring.

### Management of Category III Tracings
- **Expedite Delivery**: If intrauterine resuscitation fails to improve tracing and Category III persists, preparation for expeditious delivery (often cesarean) is warranted.

### General Principles
- FHR patterns should be interpreted in the context of the overall clinical picture.
- Continuous FHR monitoring is recommended for high-risk pregnancies.
- Intermittent auscultation is an acceptable alternative for low-risk, uncomplicated laboring patients with adequate staffing.

### Documentation
- Standardized terminology (Category I, II, III) should be used for documentation and communication.
