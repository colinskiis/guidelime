## Scope
Updated 2024 ASRM committee opinion on indications, patient selection, and treatment considerations for in vitro fertilization (IVF).

## Key Recommendations

### Indications for IVF
- **Tubal Factor Infertility**: Bilateral tubal occlusion or severe tubal disease.
- **Male Factor Infertility**: Severe oligospermia, azoospermia (with surgical sperm retrieval), or failed IUI.
- **Ovulatory Dysfunction**: Refractory to ovulation induction.
- **Endometriosis-Associated Infertility**: Especially moderate-to-severe disease.
- **Unexplained Infertility**: After failed empirical treatments.
- **Diminished Ovarian Reserve (DOR)**: IVF offers highest per-cycle success.
- **Genetic Testing**: Couples requiring PGT for genetic conditions.
- **Fertility Preservation**: Oocyte or embryo cryopreservation.

### Pre-IVF Evaluation
- Ovarian reserve testing (AMH, AFC).
- Semen analysis.
- Uterine cavity assessment (HSG, SIS, or hysteroscopy).
- Infectious disease screening.

### Ovarian Stimulation
- Individualize protocols based on patient characteristics (high responders: caution for OHSS; poor responders: consider higher doses or adjuncts).
- GnRH antagonist protocol is commonly used.

### Embryo Transfer
- **Single Embryo Transfer (SET)**: Strongly recommended for patients with good prognosis to minimize multiple pregnancy.
- Blastocyst transfer is standard when feasible.

### Preimplantation Genetic Testing (PGT)
- PGT-M for monogenic diseases.
- PGT-A for aneuploidy screening (controversial; may be offered to patients with advanced maternal age or recurrent implantation failure).

### Elective Freeze-All
- Consider freeze-all strategy for OHSS risk, elevated progesterone, or PGT.
