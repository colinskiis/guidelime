## Scope
2024 SMFM consult series on the evaluation and management of preterm labor and strategies to prevent preterm birth.

## Key Recommendations

### Definition
- Preterm labor: Regular uterine contractions with cervical change before 37 weeks.
- Threatens preterm birth, a leading cause of neonatal morbidity/mortality.

### Evaluation
- Confirm gestational age.
- Cervical length (TVUS): <25 mm at <24 weeks is short cervix.
- Fetal fibronectin (fFN): Negative test has high NPV.

### Acute Management of Preterm Labor

#### Tocolytics
- **Goal**: Delay delivery 48 hours to complete corticosteroids.
- **Nifedipine (Calcium Channel Blocker)**: First-line.
- **Indomethacin (NSAID)**: Effective, especially <32 weeks (avoid prolonged use – oligohydramnios, ductus closure).
- **Magnesium Sulfate**: Alternative; also provides neuroprotection <32 weeks.
- **Beta-Agonists (Terbutaline)**: Limited use due to side effects.
- Tocolysis is not indicated after 34 weeks; benefits diminish.

#### Antenatal Corticosteroids
- **Betamethasone or Dexamethasone**: Administer to women at risk of delivery within 7 days, between 24+0 and 33+6 weeks.
- Single rescue course may be considered if prior course >14 days ago and high risk.
- May be considered from 34+0 to 36+6 weeks if not previously received.

#### Magnesium Sulfate for Neuroprotection
- Administer if delivery expected <32 weeks to reduce risk of cerebral palsy.

### Prevention (Recurrent Preterm Birth or Short Cervix)
- **Vaginal Progesterone**: For short cervix (<25 mm) in singleton pregnancy.
- **Cerclage**: For history of prior preterm birth + short cervix.
- **17-OHPC (17-alpha hydroxyprogesterone caproate)**: Previous recommendations; recent data show limited benefit. Individualized use.

### Antibiotics
- Treat GBS-positive patients per guidelines.
- Treat concomitant infections (e.g., UTI, BV if symptomatic).
