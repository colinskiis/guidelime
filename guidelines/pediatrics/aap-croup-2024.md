## Scope
2024 AAP clinical practice guideline on the diagnosis and management of croup (laryngotracheobronchitis) in children.

## Key Recommendations

### Diagnosis
- **Clinical Diagnosis**: Barky cough ("seal bark"), inspiratory stridor, hoarseness, often preceded by URI symptoms.
- Peak age: 6 months - 3 years.
- Usually viral (parainfluenza most common).
- **Imaging**: Usually unnecessary; "steeple sign" on AP neck X-ray is classic but not required.

### Severity Assessment
- **Mild**: Occasional barky cough, no stridor at rest, no retractions.
- **Moderate**: Frequent barky cough, stridor at rest, mild-moderate retractions.
- **Severe**: Stridor at rest, significant retractions, agitation, decreased air entry, cyanosis.

### Treatment

#### Corticosteroids (All Patients)
- **Dexamethasone**: 0.15-0.6 mg/kg (usual dose 0.6 mg/kg, max 10-16 mg) PO/IM/IV single dose.
- Equivalent oral options: Prednisolone, prednisone.
- Effective for mild, moderate, and severe croup. Reduces symptoms, ED revisits, hospitalizations.

#### Nebulized Epinephrine (Moderate-Severe)
- **Racemic Epinephrine 2.25%**: 0.5 mL in 2.5 mL NS nebulized.
- **L-Epinephrine (1:1000)**: 0.5 mL/kg (max 5 mL) nebulized.
- Rapid but transient effect (1-2 hours). Observe ≥2-4 hours post-nebulization for rebound.

#### Supportive Care
- Keep child calm (agitation worsens stridor).
- Cool mist/humidified air (limited evidence but not harmful).
- Hydration.

### Hospitalization Criteria
- Persistent stridor at rest after treatment.
- Severe respiratory distress.
- Hypoxia.
- Toxic appearance or suspected bacterial tracheitis.

### Discharge
- After dexamethasone and observation (≥2-4 hours if epinephrine given) with improvement.
