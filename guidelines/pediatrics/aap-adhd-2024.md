## Scope
2024 AAP clinical practice guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and adolescents aged 4-18 years.

## Key Recommendations

### Diagnosis
- Diagnose ADHD using DSM-5-TR criteria: ≥6 symptoms of inattention and/or ≥6 symptoms of hyperactivity-impulsivity (≥5 symptoms for age ≥17), present before age 12, present in ≥2 settings, causing functional impairment.
- Obtain information from parents/caregivers AND teachers/school.
- Use validated rating scales (Vanderbilt, Conners).
- Rule out other conditions (learning disorders, anxiety, depression, sleep disorders, hearing/vision impairment).

### Treatment by Age

#### Preschool (Age 4-5)
- **First-Line**: Parent training in behavior management (PTBM).
- **Methylphenidate**: If PTBM is not available or ineffective and symptoms cause moderate-to-severe functional impairment.

#### School Age (Age 6-11)
- **Combined Therapy**: FDA-approved medication + behavioral therapy (parent training, classroom interventions, peer interventions) is most effective.
- Medication may be used as initial treatment for moderate-to-severe ADHD.

#### Adolescents (Age 12-18)
- FDA-approved medication with or without behavioral therapy.
- Involve adolescent in shared decision-making.

### Medication Options

#### Stimulants (First-Line)
- **Methylphenidate** (short, intermediate, long-acting).
- **Amphetamines** (short, intermediate, long-acting).
- High efficacy for core ADHD symptoms.

#### Non-Stimulants
- **Atomoxetine**, **Guanfacine ER**, **Clonidine ER**, **Viloxazine ER**: For patients who don't tolerate or respond to stimulants, or have comorbidities (tics, anxiety, substance use risk).

### Titration and Monitoring
- Start at low dose; titrate to optimal response with minimal side effects.
- Monitor height, weight, BP, HR, sleep, appetite, and mood.
- Reassess diagnosis and treatment annually (or more frequently).

### School Accommodations
- Educational supports (504 Plan, IEP) may be needed.
