## Scope
Evidence-based recommendations for screening, risk assessment, and treatment of hyperbilirubinemia in newborn infants ≥35 weeks gestation. Revision of 2004 guidelines.

## Key Recommendations

### Universal Screening

#### Bilirubin Measurement (Strong)
- Measure total serum bilirubin (TSB) or transcutaneous bilirubin (TcB) before discharge
- Timing: 24-48 hours of age (or before discharge if earlier)
- Plot on hour-specific nomogram

#### Risk Zone Assessment
| Risk Zone | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Low risk | Routine follow-up |
| Low-intermediate | Follow-up within 2-3 days |
| High-intermediate | Follow-up within 1-2 days |
| High risk | Consider treatment, close monitoring |

### Risk Factors for Severe Hyperbilirubinemia

#### Neurotoxicity Risk Factors
- Gestational age <38 weeks
- Albumin <3.0 g/dL
- Isoimmune hemolytic disease (DAT positive)
- G6PD deficiency
- Sepsis
- Significant clinical instability

#### Hyperbilirubinemia Risk Factors
- Previous sibling with jaundice requiring phototherapy
- Exclusive breastfeeding with suboptimal intake
- Cephalohematoma or significant bruising
- East Asian race

### Bilirubin Thresholds

#### Phototherapy Thresholds
Thresholds based on:
- Gestational age
- Postnatal age in hours
- Presence of neurotoxicity risk factors

| GA (weeks) | Without Risk Factors | With Risk Factors |
|------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| ≥38 | Higher thresholds | Lower thresholds |
| 35-37+6 | Intermediate | Lower thresholds |

*Refer to AAP hour-specific nomograms for exact values*

#### Exchange Transfusion Thresholds
- Reserved for severe hyperbilirubinemia
- Based on TSB level and clinical factors
- Immediate if acute bilirubin encephalopathy present

### Phototherapy

#### Indications
- TSB at or above hour-specific phototherapy threshold
- Rising rapidly toward threshold

#### Intensive Phototherapy
- Spectral irradiance ≥30 μW/cm²/nm
- Maximize body surface area exposed
- Use multiple light sources if needed

#### Monitoring During Phototherapy
| Parameter | Frequency |
|-----------|-----------|
| TSB | Every 4-24 hours (based on level/trend) |
| Hydration status | Ongoing |
| Temperature | Ongoing |

#### Discontinuing Phototherapy
- TSB below threshold by ≥2-3 mg/dL
- Continued decline expected
- Follow-up bilirubin within 24 hours

### Exchange Transfusion

#### Indications
- TSB at or above exchange threshold despite intensive phototherapy
- Signs of acute bilirubin encephalopathy
- Rapidly rising TSB (>0.5 mg/dL/hour)

#### Procedure
- Double-volume exchange (160-180 mL/kg)
- Use irradiated, CMV-negative blood
- Monitor during and after procedure

### Breastfeeding and Jaundice

#### Breastfeeding Support
- Encourage breastfeeding (8-12 times per day)
- Lactation support
- Monitor for adequate intake

#### When to Supplement
- Excessive weight loss (>8-10% of birth weight)
- Clinical dehydration
- Inadequate stool/urine output

#### Do NOT Discontinue Breastfeeding
- Jaundice alone is not a reason to stop breastfeeding
- Continue with supplementation if needed

### G6PD Deficiency

#### Screening
- Consider universal screening
- High-risk ethnic groups
- Family history

#### Management
- Lower phototherapy thresholds
- Avoid oxidant stressors
- Close monitoring

### Follow-Up

#### After Discharge
| Discharge Timing | Follow-Up |
|------------------|-----------|
| <24 hours | Within 24 hours |
| 24-48 hours | Within 1-2 days |
| 48-72 hours | Within 2-3 days |

#### What to Assess
- Bilirubin level (visual assessment unreliable)
- Feeding adequacy
- Weight/hydration
- Stool and urine output

### Documentation
- Pre-discharge bilirubin level
- Risk zone assignment
- Follow-up plan
- Parent education

### Parent Education
- Signs of jaundice
- Feeding adequacy
- When to seek care
- Follow-up appointments

### Prevention of Kernicterus
- Universal screening
- Timely follow-up
- Appropriate treatment thresholds
- Recognition of acute bilirubin encephalopathy
