## Scope
2024 AHA focused update on pediatric basic life support (BLS) and pediatric advanced life support (PALS).

## Key Recommendations

### High-Quality CPR
- **Compression Rate**: 100-120 compressions per minute.
- **Compression Depth**: At least 1/3 AP diameter of chest (approximately 1.5 inches in infants, 2 inches in children).
- **Full Chest Recoil**: Allow complete chest recoil between compressions.
- **Minimize Interruptions**: Limit interruptions to <10 seconds.
- **Compression-to-Ventilation Ratio**: 30:2 for single rescuer, 15:2 for two-rescuer CPR in children.

### Airway and Breathing
- Prioritize ventilations in pediatric arrest, as most are hypoxic/asphyxial in origin.
- Bag-mask ventilation is acceptable; advanced airway (ET tube or supraglottic) may be considered by trained providers.

### Defibrillation (Shockable Rhythms: VF/pVT)
- First shock: 2 J/kg.
- Second shock: 4 J/kg.
- Subsequent shocks: ≥4 J/kg, max 10 J/kg or adult dose.

### Epinephrine
- Administer epinephrine (0.01 mg/kg IV/IO, max 1 mg) as soon as vascular access is obtained for all cardiac arrest rhythms.
- Repeat every 3-5 minutes.
- Early epinephrine (within the first 5 minutes of CPR) is associated with improved outcomes.

### Post-Cardiac Arrest Care
- Targeted temperature management (normothermia or controlled hypothermia 32-34°C) may be considered for comatose patients after ROSC.
- Monitor for seizures, hypotension, and organ dysfunction.

### Systems of Care
- High-performance CPR teams and debriefing.
- Early activation of emergency response.
