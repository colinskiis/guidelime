## Scope
2024 AAP clinical practice guideline update on the management of hyperbilirubinemia in newborns ≥35 weeks' gestation.

## Key Recommendations

### Risk Assessment
- Assess all newborns for jaundice before discharge.
- Measure transcutaneous bilirubin (TcB) or total serum bilirubin (TSB).
- Plot bilirubin on hour-specific nomogram to assess risk of severe hyperbilirubinemia.

### Risk Factors for Severe Hyperbilirubinemia
- Gestational age 35-37 weeks.
- Exclusive breastfeeding (especially if suboptimal feeding).
- Isoimmune hemolytic disease (Rh, ABO incompatibility).
- G6PD deficiency.
- Previous sibling with jaundice requiring phototherapy.
- Cephalohematoma/significant bruising.
- East Asian race.

### Phototherapy Thresholds
- Use the 2022 AAP nomograms updated in 2024.
- Thresholds based on gestational age, hours of life, and neurotoxicity risk factors.
- **Intensive Phototherapy**: For levels at or near threshold.

### Exchange Transfusion Thresholds
- Reserved for bilirubin levels unresponsive to phototherapy or approaching neurotoxic levels.
- Urgent exchange transfusion for acute bilirubin encephalopathy (ABE).

### Feeding
- Encourage frequent feeding (8-12x/day) to promote bilirubin excretion.
- Supplementation with expressed breast milk or formula if intake inadequate and bilirubin rising.

### Follow-Up
- All newborns should have follow-up within 24-48 hours of discharge for bilirubin check (based on risk zone and age at discharge).

### Avoid
- Routine fluid supplementation solely to reduce bilirubin.
- Sunlight exposure as a substitute for phototherapy.
