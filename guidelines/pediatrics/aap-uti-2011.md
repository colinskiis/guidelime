## Scope
Evidence-based recommendations for diagnosis and management of initial urinary tract infection in febrile infants and young children 2-24 months of age.

## Key Recommendations

### Diagnosis

#### Urine Collection
- **Catheterization or suprapubic aspiration (SPA)** required for culture in children 2-24 months
- Bag specimens inadequate for diagnosis (high contamination rate)
- Midstream clean catch may be used in toilet-trained children

#### Diagnostic Criteria
Both required for UTI diagnosis:
1. **Urinalysis suggesting infection**: Pyuria (≥5 WBC/HPF or positive LE) AND/OR bacteriuria
2. **Urine culture**: ≥50,000 CFU/mL of a single uropathogen

### Treatment

#### Antibiotic Selection
- **Oral options**: Second or third-generation cephalosporins, amoxicillin-clavulanate
- **Parenteral options**: Ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, ampicillin + gentamicin

#### Indications for Parenteral Therapy
- Acutely ill or toxic appearance
- Persistent vomiting
- Moderate to severe dehydration
- Age <2 months (covered in separate febrile infant guideline)

#### Duration
- **7-14 days** for uncomplicated febrile UTI
- Oral therapy can be initiated or switched to once clinically stable

### Imaging

#### Renal-Bladder Ultrasound (RBUS)
- **Obtain in all children 2-24 months** after first febrile UTI
- Assesses for hydronephrosis, renal anomalies, abscess

#### Voiding Cystourethrography (VCUG)
- **NOT routine** after first febrile UTI
- **Indications**:
  - RBUS showing hydronephrosis, scarring, or findings suggesting high-grade VUR
  - Atypical or complex clinical circumstances
  - Recurrent febrile UTI

### Follow-Up
- Assess response to therapy within 48 hours
- If no improvement, reassess diagnosis and consider imaging
- No routine antimicrobial prophylaxis after first UTI with normal imaging

### Recurrent UTI
- Consider VCUG if not previously performed
- Evaluate for voiding dysfunction, constipation
- Antimicrobial prophylaxis decision individualized

## Common Pathogens
- *Escherichia coli* (most common, ~80%)
- *Klebsiella* species
- *Proteus* species
- *Enterococcus* species

## Notes
- 2016 reaffirmation confirmed continued validity of recommendations
- Does not apply to infants <2 months (see febrile infant guideline)
- Consider local resistance patterns when selecting empiric therapy
