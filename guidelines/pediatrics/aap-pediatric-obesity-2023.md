## Scope

First comprehensive AAP clinical practice guideline for evaluation and treatment of children and adolescents with overweight and obesity, including intensive health behavior and lifestyle treatment, pharmacotherapy, and metabolic/bariatric surgery.

## Notes

Five years in development. Marks significant shift toward early, intensive, evidence-based treatment. Recommends offering pharmacotherapy to adolescents 12+ with obesity, and metabolic/bariatric surgery for adolescents 13+ with severe obesity.
