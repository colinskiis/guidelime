## Scope
First comprehensive ATS guideline for managing children who have persistent moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) despite undergoing adenotonsillectomy (AT), the first-line surgical treatment for pediatric OSA.

## Key Recommendations

### Post-operative Evaluation
- **Reassessment**: All children with moderate-to-severe OSA should undergo clinical reassessment and consider repeat polysomnography (PSG) 6 weeks to 3 months after adenotonsillectomy to identify persistent disease.
- **High-Risk Groups**: Children with obesity, Down syndrome, craniofacial abnormalities, or severe baseline OSA are at highest risk for persistent OSA.

### Medical Management
- **Intranasal Corticosteroids (INS)**: Recommended as an initial adjunctive therapy for children with mild-to-moderate persistent OSA after AT.
- **Leukotriene Receptor Antagonists (LTRAs)**: May be considered in combination with INS for additive benefit.
- **Duration**: Trial for at least 8-12 weeks before assessing efficacy.

### Positive Airway Pressure (PAP) Therapy
- **Indications**: PAP therapy (CPAP or BiPAP) is recommended for children with moderate-to-severe persistent OSA who fail or are not candidates for other therapies.
- **Adherence Strategies**: Behavioral interventions and close follow-up are critical to improve PAP adherence in the pediatric population.

### Weight Management
- **Obesity**: For children with obesity, aggressive weight management and referral to a multidisciplinary weight management program are strongly recommended as a key component of treatment.

### Surgical Options
- **Maxillomandibular Advancement**: May be considered in carefully selected older children with craniofacial abnormalities.
- **Hypoglossal Nerve Stimulation (HGNS)**: Emerging as an option for adolescents, though currently with limited pediatric data.

### Multidisciplinary Care
- Management should involve a team including sleep medicine, ENT, pulmonology, and potentially orthodontics and craniofacial surgery.
