## Scope
2024 AAP clinical practice guideline on the diagnosis and management of asthma in children from infancy through adolescence.

## Key Recommendations

### Diagnosis
- Recurrent episodes of cough, wheeze, shortness of breath, chest tightness.
- Response to bronchodilator.
- Spirometry (in children ≥5 years): FEV1 reversibility ≥12%.
- Rule out other causes (foreign body, congenital anomaly, cystic fibrosis).

### Classification (NAEPP/GINA-Based)
- Intermittent, Mild Persistent, Moderate Persistent, Severe Persistent.
- Based on symptom frequency, nighttime awakenings, SABA use, FEV1, exacerbations.

### Stepwise Treatment

#### Step 1 (Intermittent)
- **SABA (Albuterol) as needed**.
- Consider low-dose ICS-formoterol as needed (MART) in select patients (aligns with GINA).

#### Step 2 (Mild Persistent)
- **Low-Dose ICS daily** (e.g., budesonide, fluticasone).
- LTRA (montelukast) is a less-preferred alternative.

#### Step 3 (Moderate Persistent)
- **Low-Dose ICS + LABA** OR **Medium-Dose ICS**.

#### Step 4-5 (Severe Persistent)
- **Medium-High Dose ICS + LABA**.
- Specialist referral.

#### Step 6
- Add-on therapies: Tiotropium, biologics (omalizumab for allergic asthma ≥6 years, dupilumab, mepolizumab).

### Exacerbation Management
- SABA (nebulizer or MDI + spacer).
- Oral corticosteroids if moderate-severe exacerbation.
- Hospitalization if refractory to initial treatment.

### Asthma Action Plan
- Written, individualized plan for home management of symptoms and exacerbations.
- Green/Yellow/Red zone approach.

### Key Pearls
- Use spacer with MDI for all children.
- Assess and treat comorbidities: Allergic rhinitis, GERD, obesity.
- Reduce exposure triggers: Tobacco smoke, allergens.
