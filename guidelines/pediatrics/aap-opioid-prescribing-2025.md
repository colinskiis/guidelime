## Scope
Comprehensive evidence-based recommendations for pediatricians on the safe and effective use of opioids for managing acute pain in outpatient settings, emphasizing multimodal analgesia and safety protocols.

## Key Recommendations

### Multimodal Analgesia (First-line)
- **Non-opioid Preferred**: For most acute pain conditions, start with non-opioid analgesics (e.g., ibuprofen and acetaminophen).
- **Scheduled Dosing**: Use scheduled dosing of non-opioids rather than "as needed" for the first 24-48 hours.

### Indications for Opioids
- **Moderate-to-Severe Pain**: Opioids should be reserved for moderate-to-severe pain that is not expected to be controlled by non-opioid measures alone.
- **Short-term Use**: Prescribe only for the expected duration of severe pain (typically ≤3 days).

### Prescribing and Doses
- **Lowest Effective Dose**: Start with the lowest effective dose of an immediate-release opioid.
- **Agent Selection**: Morphine or oxycodone are preferred over codeine or tramadol (due to unpredictable metabolism in children).
- **Avoid Combination Products**: Recommends prescribing opioids and non-opioids separately to allow for accurate dosing and tapering.

### Safety Protocols
- **NPSMP Review**: Check the state Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) before prescribing.
- **Storage and Disposal**: Educate families on secure storage (ideally locked) and prompt disposal of unused medication.
- **Naloxone**: Consider co-prescribing naloxone for patients at higher risk of respiratory depression.

### Monitoring and Follow-up
- **Anticipatory Guidance**: Provide clear instructions on what to expect, common side effects (constipation, nausea), and when to call the office.
- **Reassessment**: Plan for a follow-up (in-person or telehealth) if pain persists beyond the initial expected duration.
