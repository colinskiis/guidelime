## Scope
Evidence-based recommendations for diagnosis, management, and prevention of bronchiolitis in children 1-23 months of age.

## Key Recommendations

### Diagnosis
- **Clinical diagnosis**: Based on history and physical examination
- **Lab studies**: Should NOT be routinely ordered for diagnosis
- **Radiologic studies**: Should NOT be routinely ordered for diagnosis
- Typical presentation: viral URI prodrome followed by increased respiratory effort (tachypnea, nasal flaring, retractions, wheezing, crackles)

### What NOT to Use (Strong Evidence Against)
- **Bronchodilators (albuterol/salbutamol)**: Should NOT be administered
- **Epinephrine**: Should NOT be routinely administered
- **Corticosteroids**: Should NOT be administered
- **Antibiotics**: Should NOT be used unless concurrent bacterial infection documented
- **Nebulized hypertonic saline**: Should NOT be used in ED setting
- **Chest physiotherapy**: Should NOT be used

### Supportive Care (Recommended)
- **Hydration**: Maintain adequate fluid intake
- **Oxygen**: Supplement if SpO2 <90% (some centers use 92%)
- **Suctioning**: Nasal suctioning for upper airway obstruction
- **Monitoring**: Observe for apnea in high-risk infants

### Hospital Admission Criteria
Consider admission for:
- Respiratory distress/failure
- Hypoxemia (SpO2 <90%)
- Inability to maintain hydration
- High-risk infants (premature, age <12 weeks, hemodynamically significant heart disease)

### RSV Prevention (Updated 2023-2024)

#### Nirsevimab (Monoclonal Antibody)
- **FDA approved** for infants ≤8 months born during or entering first RSV season
- Also for high-risk children up to 24 months entering second RSV season
- Single dose provides protection for entire RSV season
- ~59-63% reduction in bronchiolitis episodes, hospitalizations, and PICU admissions

#### Maternal RSV Vaccination
- **Abrysvo (RSVpreF)**: Bivalent vaccine for pregnant people at 32-36 weeks gestation
- Provides passive antibody protection to newborns

#### Palivizumab
- Reserved for highest-risk infants if nirsevimab unavailable
- Monthly doses during RSV season

## Notes
- RSV is most common cause of bronchiolitis
- Peak incidence: 2-6 months of age
- Most cases resolve with supportive care
- Prevention strategies have significantly expanded with 2023-2024 product approvals
