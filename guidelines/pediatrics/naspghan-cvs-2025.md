## Scope
2025 NASPGHAN guideline for the diagnosis of cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) in children and adolescents.

## Key Recommendations

### Diagnostic Criteria (Based on Rome IV)
- **Episode Pattern**: At least 2 episodes of intense, stereotypical vomiting lasting hours to days.
- **Symptom-Free Intervals**: Return to baseline health between episodes.
- **Stereotypical Pattern**: Each episode is similar in timing, symptoms, and duration for the individual patient.
- **Exclusion of Organic Disease**: Other causes of episodic vomiting must be ruled out.

### Alarm Features (Red Flags)
Consider alternative diagnoses if present:
- Bilious vomiting
- Severe abdominal pain with tenderness
- Neurological signs (papilledema, ataxia, altered consciousness)
- Progressive worsening of episodes
- Failure to return to baseline between episodes

### Evaluation
- **Limited Workup**: For classic presentation without red flags, extensive testing is often unnecessary.
- **Consider**: Basic metabolic panel, liver function tests, amylase/lipase to rule out acute metabolic or pancreatic causes.
- **If Indicated**: Upper GI series, esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), brain MRI (for atypical neurological features), metabolic/genetic testing (if suspected metabolic disorder).

### Association with Migraine
- CVS is considered a migraine-related disorder. Family history of migraine is common. Some children develop classic migraine headaches later in life.

### Initial Management Approach
- During acute episodes: Supportive care with IV fluids, antiemetics (e.g., ondansetron), and quiet/dark environment.
- For prophylaxis (in moderate-severe/frequent cases): Cyproheptadine (younger children), amitriptyline, or topiramate.
- Identify and avoid triggers (e.g., stress, sleep deprivation, certain foods).
