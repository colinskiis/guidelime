## Scope
2025 updated immunization recommendations from the AAP, providing specific guidance for pediatricians on the timing and administration of vaccines to protect children and adolescents against vaccine-preventable diseases.

## Key Recommendations

### COVID-19 Vaccination
- **Infants (6–23 months)**: Strong recommendation for **universal vaccination** with a complete series of age-appropriate COVID-19 vaccine.
- **Children/Adolescents (2–18 years)**: Recommends **risk-based vaccination** (e.g., for those with underlying chronic conditions) while also supporting the choice of vaccination for all children to prevent severe disease and community spread.

### Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) Protection
- **Infants <8 months**: Recommends Nirsevimab (monoclonal antibody) for all infants born during or entering their first RSV season.
- **High-Risk Children (8–19 months)**: Recommends a second dose of Nirsevimab for those entering their second RSV season if they have relevant high-risk conditions (e.g., chronic lung disease of prematurity, hemodynamically significant CHD).

### Influenza Vaccination
- **Universal Recommendation**: Mandatory annual influenza vaccination for all children starting at 6 months of age.
- **Timing**: Ideally administered in September or October to provide protection throughout the peak season.

### Human Papillomavirus (HPV)
- **Initiation**: Recommends starting the HPV series at age 9 or 10 rather than waiting until age 11 or 12 to ensure completion before potential exposure and to take advantage of superior immune response at younger ages.
- **2-Dose Schedule**: Remains the standard for those starting before age 15.

### Meningococcal Disease
- **Meningococcal Pentavalent (MenABCWY)**: Recommends the use of the pentavalent vaccine in adolescents (11-12y and 16y) to simplify the schedule and improve coverage for serogroup B alongside A, C, W, and Y.

### Healthcare Equity and Access
- Addresses vaccine hesitancy through "presumptive recommendation" and clear communication of safety and benefit.
- Advocates for the removal of cost barriers to ensure all children have timely access to the full recommended schedule.
