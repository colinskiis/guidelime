## Scope

This guideline provides recommendations for the diagnosis and management of bronchiolitis in infants and children up to 2 years of age.

## Key Recommendations

### Diagnosis
- Clinical diagnosis based on history and physical examination
- Typical: Rhinorrhea, cough, wheezing, increased work of breathing
- Viral testing not routinely needed (may guide cohorting, reduce antibiotics)
- CXR not routinely recommended

### Risk Factors for Severe Disease
- Prematurity (<29 weeks GA)
- Chronic lung disease of prematurity
- Hemodynamically significant heart disease
- Immunodeficiency
- Neuromuscular disease affecting airway clearance

### Supportive Care (Mainstays of Treatment)
**Strong Recommendations:**
- Supplemental oxygen for SpO2 <90% (some accept <88%)
- Nasopharyngeal suctioning for nasal congestion affecting feeding/breathing
- Ensure adequate hydration (oral or IV/NG if needed)

**Monitoring:**
- Continuous pulse oximetry not routinely required in stable patients
- Intermittent assessment appropriate

### Therapies NOT Recommended
- Bronchodilators (albuterol): Not routinely recommended
- Epinephrine: Not routinely recommended
- Corticosteroids: Not recommended
- Chest physiotherapy: Not recommended
- Antibiotics (unless bacterial infection confirmed)

### High-Flow Nasal Cannula (HFNC)
- May be considered for moderate-severe respiratory distress
- Insufficient evidence for routine use
- Initiated in appropriate setting with monitoring

### Prevention
- Nirsevimab for all infants <8 months during first RSV season
- Maternal RSV vaccination during pregnancy
- Palivizumab for high-risk infants if nirsevimab unavailable

### Discharge Criteria
- Stable oxygen saturations
- Adequate oral intake
- Caregiver education on warning signs
