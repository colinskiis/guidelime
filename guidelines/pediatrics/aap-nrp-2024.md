## Scope
2024 update to the AAP/AHA Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP) algorithm for the immediate care and resuscitation of newborns.

## Key Recommendations

### Initial Assessment (First 30-60 Seconds)
- **Rapid Evaluation**: Term gestation? Good tone? Breathing or crying?
- **Delayed Cord Clamping**: ≥30-60 seconds for vigorous term and preterm infants.
- **Initial Steps**: Warm, dry, position airway, clear secretions if necessary, stimulate.

### Evaluation After Initial Steps
- Assess heart rate (palpate umbilical cord or auscultate) and respirations.
- If HR <100 bpm or not breathing/gasping → Positive Pressure Ventilation (PPV).

### Positive Pressure Ventilation (PPV)
- **Most Critical Intervention**. Effective ventilation is key.
- Use room air (21% O2) for term infants; 21-30% for preterm.
- Rate: 40-60 breaths/min.
- Assess MR SOPA (Mask adjustment, Reposition airway, Suction, Open mouth, Pressure increase, Airway alternative) if chest rise not adequate.

### Chest Compressions
- If HR <60 bpm despite effective PPV for 30-60 seconds → start chest compressions.
- Technique: Two-thumb encircling hands preferred. Compress lower 1/3 of sternum.
- Ratio: 3:1 (3 compressions : 1 breath, ~120 events/min).
- Increase O2 to 100% during compressions.

### Epinephrine
- If HR remains <60 bpm despite effective ventilation and compressions → epinephrine.
- **Dose**: 0.01-0.03 mg/kg IV/IO (preferred) or 0.05-0.1 mg/kg via ET tube.
- Repeat every 3-5 minutes if HR remains <60 bpm.

### Umbilical Vein Catheterization (UVC)
- Fastest access for medications and volume.

### Volume Expansion
- If hypovolemia suspected (pale, weak pulses, no response to resuscitation): 10 mL/kg NS or O-negative blood.

### Post-Resuscitation Care
- Monitor temperature, glucose, appropriate respiratory support, consider therapeutic hypothermia for HIE.
