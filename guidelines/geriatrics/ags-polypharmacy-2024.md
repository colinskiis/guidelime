## Scope
2024 AGS expert consensus on addressing polypharmacy and implementing deprescribing strategies in older adults.

## Key Recommendations

### Definition
- **Polypharmacy**: Use of ≥5 medications. Often associated with increased risk of adverse drug events, drug-drug interactions, falls, cognitive impairment, and non-adherence.

### When to Conduct Medication Review
- At transitions of care (hospital discharge, new admission to long-term care).
- After a fall, hospitalization, or new diagnosis.
- When adding a new medication ("prescribing cascade" check).
- Periodically (at least annually) for all older adults on multiple medications.

### Deprescribing Approach
1. **Ascertain all medications**: Include OTC, supplements, herbals.
2. **Assess each medication**: Is there still an indication? Is the benefit > harm for this patient?
3. **Prioritize for deprescribing**: Target medications with high harm potential (Beers Criteria, STOPP/START), those without clear indication, or those contributing to a drug cascade.
4. **Implement gradual withdrawal**: Taper when appropriate (e.g., PPIs, benzodiazepines, antidepressants).
5. **Monitor and support**: Watch for withdrawal symptoms or return of the original condition.

### High-Priority Targets for Deprescribing
- Proton pump inhibitors (long-term use without indication).
- Benzodiazepines and Z-drugs.
- Opioids.
- Anticholinergic medications.
- High-risk diabetes medications (long-acting sulfonylureas).
- Antipsychotics in dementia (unless for severe agitation without alternatives).

### Shared Decision-Making
- Engage the patient and family/caregivers. Discuss goals of care, life expectancy, and priorities.
