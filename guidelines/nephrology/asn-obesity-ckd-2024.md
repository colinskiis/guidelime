## Scope
Inaugural ASN Kidney Health Guidance providing practical recommendations for the management of obesity in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), those on dialysis, and kidney transplant recipients.

## Key Recommendations

### General Principles
- **Obesity is common in CKD**: Contributes to CKD progression, cardiovascular disease, and worse transplant outcomes.
- **Treat the individual, not just the BMI**: Address metabolic health and functional status.

### Lifestyle Intervention
- **Diet**: Caloric restriction with adequate protein intake (0.8-1.0 g/kg/day for non-dialysis CKD; higher for dialysis).
- **Physical Activity**: Encourage regular physical activity appropriate for the patient's functional capacity.

### Pharmacotherapy
- **GLP-1 Receptor Agonists (Semaglutide, Liraglutide)**: Can be used in patients with CKD (stages 1-4) for weight loss and have shown cardiovascular and potential renal benefits. Dose adjustment may be needed.
- **Tirzepatide (GLP-1/GIP dual agonist)**: Also effective for weight loss; data in CKD is emerging.
- **Caution in Dialysis**: Limited data on GLP-1 RAs in patients on dialysis; use with caution.

### Bariatric/Metabolic Surgery
- **Before Transplantation**: May be considered for patients with severe obesity who are transplant candidates, as it may improve candidacy and post-transplant outcomes.
- **After Transplantation**: Can be performed safely in selected kidney transplant recipients.

### Kidney Transplant Recipients
- Weight management is important for graft and patient survival. GLP-1 RAs may be considered. Monitor for drug-drug interactions with immunosuppressive agents.

### Multidisciplinary Approach
- Recommend a team including nephrologists, dietitians, and obesity medicine specialists.
