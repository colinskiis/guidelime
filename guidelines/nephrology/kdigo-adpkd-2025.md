## Scope
The first comprehensive KDIGO guideline addressing the diagnosis, prognosis, and management of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) in adults and children.

## Key Recommendations

### Diagnosis and Genetic Testing
- **Nomenclature**: Formally adopts ADPKD as the preferred term.
- **Genetic Testing**: Recommended when clinical diagnosis is uncertain, for family planning (including PGT-M), and for evaluating young related kidney donor candidates.
- **Imaging**: Ultrasound remains the primary diagnostic tool; MRI/CT preferred for measuring Total Kidney Volume (TKV) for prognostic purposes.

### Prognostic Stratification
- **Risk Assessment**: Use of the Mayo Clinic Classification (Class 1A-1E) based on height-adjusted Total Kidney Volume (htTKV) and age to predict the risk of rapid progression to kidney failure.
- **PROPKD Score**: Can be used alongside genetic data to further refine prognosis.

### Pharmacological Management
- **Tolvaptan (V2 Receptor Antagonist)**: Recommended for adults with ADPKD who are at high risk of rapid progression (e.g., Mayo Class 1C, 1D, 1E).
  - **Monitoring**: Frequent monitoring of liver function tests (LFTs) is mandatory due to the risk of hepatotoxicity.
- **Blood Pressure**: Target ≤120/80 mmHg using ACE inhibitors or ARBs as first-line therapy to slow kidney volume growth and slow eGFR decline.

### Lifestyle and General Care
- **Hydration**: Recommend high fluid intake (>3 L/day) to suppress vasopressin, unless contraindicated by advanced CKD.
- **Sodium**: Diet low in sodium (<2 g/day) to help control blood pressure and reduce vasopressin levels.
- **Protein**: Avoid high-protein diets; maintain a moderate protein intake (0.8 g/kg/day).

### Management of Complications
- **Polycystic Liver Disease (PLD)**: Monitor for symptoms of mass effect; consider somatostatin analogs in symptomatic patients with significant liver enlargement.
- **Intracranial Aneurysms (ICA)**: Screening recommended for those with a family history of ICA or subarachnoid hemorrhage, or those in high-risk occupations (e.g., pilots).
- **Pain Management**: Step-wise approach starting with non-pharmacologic and non-opioid measures; cyst aspiration or surgery for refractory pain from large cysts.
