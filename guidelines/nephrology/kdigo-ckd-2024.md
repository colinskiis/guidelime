Comprehensive guideline for evaluation, risk stratification, and management of chronic kidney disease in adults and children, including pharmacotherapy, lifestyle, and preparation for kidney replacement therapy.

## Notes

Major update after 12 years (since 2012). Includes 28 recommendations and 141 practice points. Developed with patient partners. Substantially broader evidence base than 2012 version. Key updates include SGLT2 inhibitor recommendations and updated cardiovascular risk management.
