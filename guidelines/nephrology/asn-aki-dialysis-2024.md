## Scope
2024 ASN Kidney Health Guidance on the outpatient management of patients with acute kidney injury requiring dialysis post-hospital discharge.

## Key Recommendations

### Transition of Care
- Ensure a structured handoff from inpatient to outpatient nephrology.
- Schedule outpatient nephrology follow-up within 1-2 weeks of discharge.
- Communicate likelihood of renal recovery and prognosis to patient and outpatient team.

### Vascular Access
- Temporary dialysis catheters (tunneled or non-tunneled) may be used initially.
- If recovery is not anticipated within weeks, consider planning for more permanent access (AV fistula or graft) early.

### Monitoring for Renal Recovery
- **Serial Assessment**: Monitor urine output and serum creatinine trends.
- **Trial off Dialysis**: For patients with improving kidney function (increasing urine output, declining creatinine), consider a trial of extending interdialytic interval or stopping dialysis with close monitoring.

### Indications to Continue Dialysis
- Persistent oliguria/anuria.
- Refractory hyperkalemia, volume overload, or uremia.
- No improvement in GFR despite time.

### Medication Management
- Adjust renally-excreted medications.
- Avoid nephrotoxins where possible.
- Manage comorbidities (diabetes, hypertension) to optimize recovery environment.

### Long-Term Outcomes
- Many patients with dialysis-requiring AKI recover kidney function, but some transition to CKD or ESKD.
- Patient education on CKD prevention and ongoing nephrology follow-up is essential.
