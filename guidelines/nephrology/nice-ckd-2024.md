## Scope
2024 update to NICE guideline NG203 on the assessment and management of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in adults.

## Key Recommendations

### Diagnosis and Staging
- **eGFR**: Use CKD-EPI equation.
- **CKD Definition**: eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73m² and/or albuminuria (ACR ≥3 mg/mmol) for ≥3 months.
- **Staging**: G1-G5 (based on eGFR) and A1-A3 (based on ACR).

### Risk Stratification
- Use eGFR and ACR together to assess risk of progression, cardiovascular events, and mortality.

### Referral to Nephrology
- eGFR <30 (G4-G5).
- ACR ≥70 mg/mmol (unless diabetic and already on optimal treatment).
- Rapid decline (≥25% drop in eGFR or ≥15 mL/min in 12 months).
- Poorly controlled hypertension, suspected rare or genetic cause, suspected renal artery stenosis.

### Blood Pressure Management
- **Target**: <140/90 mmHg general; <130/80 mmHg if ACR ≥70 mg/mmol.
- **Diabetes + CKD**: <130/80 mmHg.
- **ACE Inhibitor or ARB**: First-line for CKD with proteinuria or diabetes. Monitor potassium and creatinine.

### SGLT2 Inhibitors
- **Strongly Recommended**: For CKD with eGFR ≥20 and ACR ≥22.6 mg/mmol (≥200 mg/g) or with type 2 diabetes.
- Dapagliflozin, empagliflozin have established renoprotective benefits.

### Lipid Management
- Offer statin therapy (atorvastatin 20 mg) for primary CVD prevention in CKD.

### Anemia
- Investigate if Hb <110 g/L (men) or <100 g/L (women). Iron replacement first; consider ESA if iron-replete and Hb remains low.

### Preparation for Renal Replacement Therapy
- Timely education and access creation (AV fistula) for patients progressing to ESKD.
