## Scope

This guideline provides updated recommendations for the prevention, detection, and management of acute kidney injury (AKI) in hospitalized patients.

## Key Recommendations

### Definition and Staging
- AKI defined by sCr increase ≥0.3 mg/dL within 48h OR ≥1.5x baseline within 7 days
- Stage 1: sCr 1.5-1.9x baseline or ≥0.3 mg/dL increase
- Stage 2: sCr 2.0-2.9x baseline
- Stage 3: sCr ≥3x baseline or RRT initiation

### Prevention
- Volume optimization with crystalloids
- Avoid nephrotoxins when possible
- Hold ACEi/ARB during acute illness
- Contrast-associated AKI prevention: Isotonic saline hydration
- Do not use N-acetylcysteine for contrast prophylaxis

### Risk Assessment
- Identify high-risk populations (CKD, diabetes, heart failure)
- Electronic health record alerts for AKI detection
- Biomarkers (NGAL, KIM-1) for early detection research use

### Management
- Treat underlying cause
- Optimize hemodynamics and volume status
- Avoid hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia
- Nutritional support: Protein 0.8-1.0 g/kg in non-catabolic; 1.0-1.5 g/kg in catabolic/RRT

### Renal Replacement Therapy
- Initiate for life-threatening complications (hyperkalemia, uremia, acidosis, pulmonary edema)
- Timing: Avoidance of urgent indications vs. early RRT—individualized decision
- Modality: CRRT vs. IHD based on hemodynamic stability
- Anticoagulation: Regional citrate preferred in CRRT

### Recovery and Follow-up
- Monitor kidney function post-AKI
- Nephrology follow-up for stages 2-3 AKI
- Address CKD risk factors
