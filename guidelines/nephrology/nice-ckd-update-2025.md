## Scope
Updated evidence-based recommendations for the early identification, classification, and management of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in adults, children, and young people.

## Key Recommendations

### Classification and Risk Assessment
- **Criteria**: CKD is classified based on eGFR (G1-G5) and albuminuria (A1-A3).
- **Cystatin C**: Consider using Cystatin C-based eGFR for a more accurate assessment if creatinine-based eGFR is between 45-59 ml/min and there is no other evidence of kidney damage.
- **Risk Calculation**: Recommends the 4-variable or 8-variable Kidney Failure Risk Equation (KFRE) to predict the 5-year risk of needing renal replacement therapy for patients with GFR <60.

### Pharmacological Management
- **SGLT2 Inhibitors**: Strong recommendation to offer an SGLT2 inhibitor (e.g., dapagliflozin or empagliflozin) to adults with CKD who meet specific criteria (e.g., proteinuria or comorbid T2D/HF) to slow progression and reduce CV risk.
- **RAAS Inhibitors**: Continue to offer ACE inhibitors or ARBs at the highest tolerated dose for those with proteinuria (ACR ≥3 mg/mmol and diabetes, or ACR ≥30 mg/mmol regardless of diabetes).
- **Target Blood Pressure**: Aim for <130/80 mmHg in patients with CKD and proteinuria (ACR ≥70 mg/mmol). For others, aim for <140/90 mmHg.

### Monitoring and Follow-up
- **Frequency**: Based on the risk of progression (a combination of GFR and ACR), ranging from annually to every 3-6 months.
- **Referral to Specialist**: Refer to a nephrologist if there is a rapid decline in GFR (e.g., >25% in 1 year), sustained ACR ≥70 mg/mmol, or suspected rare/genetic causes.

### Comorbidity Management
- **Cardiovascular Risk**: Aggressive management of lipids and lifestyle factors, as cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in CKD.
- **Mineral Bone Disease**: Screen for calcium, phosphate, and PTH abnormalities in advanced CKD (G3b-G5).

### Patient Support
- Enable shared decision-making, providing clear information about the nature of CKD, its impact on health, and the benefits/risks of different management strategies.
