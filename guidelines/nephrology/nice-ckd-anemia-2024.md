## Scope
2024 NICE guideline update on the diagnosis and management of anemia in adults with chronic kidney disease.

## Key Recommendations

### Diagnosis
- Check Hb in all CKD patients:
  - CKD stages 3-5: At least annually; more frequently in advanced stages.
- **Anemia Definition**: Hb <130 g/L (men), <120 g/L (women).
- **Iron Studies**: Ferritin, TSAT (transferrin saturation), ± reticulocyte Hb content.

### Iron Management

#### Iron Deficiency
- **Functional Iron Deficiency** (TSAT <20% or ferritin <100 ng/mL in non-dialysis CKD, <200 ng/mL in dialysis).
- **IV Iron (Preferred for Dialysis Patients and ESA Users)**: More effective than oral.
- **Oral Iron**: May be tried in non-dialysis CKD but often poorly absorbed and not tolerated.

#### Iron Targets
- Maintain ferritin 200-500 ng/mL, TSAT 20-30%.

### Erythropoiesis-Stimulating Agents (ESAs)
- Start ESA if Hb <100 g/L after iron repletion and if anemia is symptomatic or Hb falling.
- **ESAs**: Epoetin alfa, darbepoetin alfa, methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta.
- **Hemoglobin Target**: 100-120 g/L. Avoid Hb >130 g/L.
- Titrate dose to achieve target and avoid fluctuations.

### HIF-PHI (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor Prolyl Hydroxylase Inhibitors)
- **Roxadustat, Daprodustat, Vadadustat**: Oral agents for CKD anemia.
- Alternative to ESAs, especially for ESA-resistant anemia or patient preference for oral therapy.
- Monitor for thromboembolic events.

### Monitoring
- Hb monthly during ESA initiation; every 1-3 months once stable.
- Iron studies every 1-3 months.

### Blood Transfusion
- Avoid routine transfusion; reserve for severe symptomatic anemia or acute blood loss.
- Be mindful of HLA sensitization in transplant candidates.
