## Scope
Updated evidence-based recommendations for clinicians managing adults with acute and chronic rhinosinusitis, focusing on diagnostic precision and appropriate use of evidence-based therapies.

## Key Recommendations

### Diagnosis: Acute Bacterial Rhinosinusitis (ABRS)
- **Clinical Criteria**: Clinicians should diagnose ABRS when:
  1. Symptoms persist for ≥10 days without clinical improvement.
  2. Symptoms are severe (e.g., high fever ≥39°C and purulent nasal discharge) for ≥3-4 days.
  3. "Double-sickening": Symptoms worsen after an initial period of viral improvement.
- **Viral vs. Bacterial**: Emphasizes that most acute rhinosinusitis is viral (AVRS) and does not require antibiotics.

### Management: ABRS
- **Watchful Waiting**: Recommends watchful waiting (for 7 days) as an option for uncomplicated ABRS with mild symptoms.
- **First-line Antibiotics**: Amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanate are the preferred first-line options for those requiring antibiotics.
- **Macrolides**: Recommends **against** prescribing macrolides (e.g., azithromycin) for empiric ABRS due to high rates of pneumococcal resistance.

### Diagnosis: Chronic Rhinosinusitis (CRS)
- **Confirmation**: Diagnosis of CRS (≥12 weeks duration) requires objective confirmation of sinonasal inflammation (e.g., via nasal endoscopy or CT imaging) in addition to clinical symptoms.

### Management: Chronic Rhinosinusitis (CRS)
- **Topical Corticosteroids**: Strongly recommended for all patients with CRS.
- **Saline Irrigation**: Large-volume saline irrigation is recommended for symptom relief and to improve the effectiveness of topical steroids.
- **Specialty Referral**: Patients with symptoms refractory to initial medical management or those with red-flag symptoms should be referred for endoscopic evaluation.

### Patient Education and Stewardship
- **Expectation Management**: Educate patients on the expected duration of symptoms (1-2 weeks for acute cases) and the lack of benefit for antibiotics in viral infections.
- **Avoidance**: Discourages the use of systemic corticosteroids or antifungal agents for uncomplicated ABRS.
