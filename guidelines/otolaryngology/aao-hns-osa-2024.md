## Scope
2024 AAO-HNS clinical practice guideline on the evaluation and management of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in adults.

## Key Recommendations

### Diagnosis
- **Polysomnography (PSG)**: Gold standard for OSA diagnosis.
- **Home Sleep Apnea Testing (HSAT)**: Acceptable for patients with high pretest probability of moderate-to-severe OSA without significant comorbidities.
- Severity: Mild (AHI 5-15), moderate (15-30), severe (>30).

### Initial Evaluation
- Complete head and neck examination to identify anatomic factors contributing to airway obstruction (tonsils, retrognathia, nasal obstruction, macroglossia).
- Drug-induced sleep endoscopy (DISE) may be considered to evaluate dynamic airway collapse.

### Treatment Options

#### First-Line
- **Positive Airway Pressure (PAP)**: CPAP or auto-PAP. Most effective treatment for moderate-to-severe OSA. Emphasize adherence strategies.

#### Alternatives / Adjuncts
- **Oral Appliances (Mandibular Advancement Devices)**: For mild-to-moderate OSA or CPAP-intolerant patients. Custom-fitted by dentist.
- **Weight Loss**: Recommended for overweight/obese patients. Significant weight loss can improve or resolve OSA.
- **Positional Therapy**: For patients with positional OSA.

#### Surgical Options
- **Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP)**: May be offered for select patients with palatal obstruction who cannot tolerate CPAP.
- **Hypoglossal Nerve Stimulation (Inspire)**: For moderate-to-severe OSA (AHI 15-65), BMI ≤40, predominantly tongue-based obstruction, CPAP failure.
- **Nasal Surgery, Tonsillectomy, Tongue Base Reduction, Maxillomandibular Advancement**: Selected based on anatomy and site of obstruction.

### Perioperative OSA
- Screen surgical patients for OSA.
- Use continuous oximetry postoperatively for patients with known or suspected OSA.
