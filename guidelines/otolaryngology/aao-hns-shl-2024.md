## Scope
2024 AAO-HNS clinical practice guideline update on the diagnosis and management of sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSHL) in adults.

## Key Recommendations

### Definition
- SSHL: Sensorineural hearing loss of ≥30 dB over ≥3 contiguous frequencies occurring within 72 hours.

### Diagnosis
- **Distinguish SNHL from Conductive Hearing Loss**: Physical exam (tuning fork – Weber, Rinne), audiometry.
- **Audiometry**: Obtain promptly to confirm SNHL.
- **MRI with Gadolinium (IAC protocol)**: Consider to rule out retrocochlear pathology (vestibular schwannoma, stroke, demyelinating disease). May be done at initial workup or if no recovery occurs.

### Initial Evaluation
- Assess for identifiable/treatable causes (otitis media, cholesteatoma, autoimmune, Meniere's, trauma, ototoxicity).
- Routine lab tests (CBC, FBG, etc.) are not required unless history suggests specific etiology.

### Treatment

#### Corticosteroids (First-Line, Within 2 Weeks of Onset)
- **Oral Corticosteroids**: Prednisone 1 mg/kg/day (max 60 mg) x 10-14 days with taper.
- **Intratympanic Corticosteroids**: May be offered as primary therapy (if systemic steroids contraindicated) or as salvage therapy if no recovery after oral steroids.

#### Salvage Therapy
- If no improvement after initial treatment, offer intratympanic steroid injection(s).

### Hyperbaric Oxygen
- May be offered within 2-4 weeks of SSHL onset as adjunct or salvage therapy. Evidence is limited but some benefit observed.

### Rehabilitation
- **Hearing Aids or CROS Device**: For persistent hearing loss.
- Cochlear implantation may be considered for profound unilateral or bilateral deafness.

### Counseling
- Discuss natural history (~30-65% spontaneous recovery), treatment options, and rehabilitation strategies.
