## Scope
Evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis and management of adult rhinosinusitis, including acute and chronic forms. Update of 2015 guidelines.

## Key Recommendations

### Classification

#### Acute Rhinosinusitis (ARS)
- Duration: Up to 4 weeks
- Viral (most common) vs. bacterial

#### Subacute Rhinosinusitis
- Duration: 4-12 weeks

#### Chronic Rhinosinusitis (CRS)
- Duration: ≥12 weeks
- With or without nasal polyps (CRSwNP, CRSsNP)

#### Recurrent Acute Rhinosinusitis
- ≥4 episodes per year with symptom-free intervals

### Diagnosis of Acute Bacterial Rhinosinusitis (ABRS)

#### Clinical Criteria (Strong)
Suspect ABRS if any of:
- Persistent symptoms ≥10 days without improvement
- Severe symptoms (high fever ≥39°C, purulent discharge) for ≥3-4 days
- "Double worsening" - initial improvement then worsening

#### Symptoms
| Cardinal Symptoms | Secondary Symptoms |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Nasal obstruction | Headache |
| Purulent rhinorrhea | Facial pressure |
| Facial pain/pressure | Ear fullness |
| Hyposmia/anosmia | Dental pain |

### Diagnostic Testing

#### Imaging
- **Not recommended for uncomplicated ARS** (Strong Against)
- CT for: Suspected complications, failed medical therapy, recurrent episodes
- MRI for: Suspected intracranial or orbital involvement

#### Nasal Endoscopy
- Recommended for chronic or recurrent cases
- Evaluate for polyps, anatomic abnormalities, purulence

#### Allergy Testing
- Consider if symptoms suggest allergic rhinitis
- IgE testing or skin prick testing

### Treatment of Acute Rhinosinusitis

#### Watchful Waiting (Strong)
- Appropriate for uncomplicated ABRS
- Offer symptomatic treatment
- Re-evaluate if worsening or no improvement in 7 days

#### Symptomatic Treatment
| Treatment | Recommendation |
|-----------|---------------|
| Saline irrigation | Recommended |
| Intranasal corticosteroids | May be offered |
| Analgesics | For pain relief |
| Decongestants | Short-term use (≤3 days for topical) |

#### Antibiotic Therapy
- First-line: **Amoxicillin-clavulanate** (Strong)
- Duration: 5-7 days for adults
- Alternative (penicillin allergy): Doxycycline or respiratory fluoroquinolone

#### Do NOT Routinely Use
- Systemic corticosteroids for uncomplicated ARS
- Antihistamines (unless allergic rhinitis present)
- Prolonged topical decongestants

### Treatment of Chronic Rhinosinusitis

#### Medical Management (Initial)
- Saline irrigation (daily)
- Intranasal corticosteroids
- Consider short course of oral corticosteroids for CRSwNP

#### When to Consider Surgery
- Failed appropriate medical therapy (≥3 months)
- Anatomic abnormalities contributing to symptoms
- Complications

#### Surgical Options
- Functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS)
- Balloon sinuplasty (selected cases)

### Biologics for CRSwNP

#### Indications
- Severe CRSwNP refractory to medical/surgical treatment

#### Available Agents
| Agent | Target |
|-------|--------|
| Dupilumab | IL-4/IL-13 |
| Omalizumab | IgE |
| Mepolizumab | IL-5 |

### Complications of Sinusitis

#### Orbital
- Preseptal cellulitis
- Orbital cellulitis
- Subperiosteal abscess

#### Intracranial
- Meningitis
- Epidural abscess
- Brain abscess
- Cavernous sinus thrombosis

#### Management of Complications
- Urgent imaging (CT with contrast, MRI)
- IV antibiotics
- Surgical drainage if indicated
- Ophthalmology and/or neurosurgery consultation

### Follow-Up
- Uncomplicated ARS: Re-evaluate if no improvement in 7 days
- CRS: Regular follow-up to assess treatment response
- Post-surgical: Monitor for recurrence
