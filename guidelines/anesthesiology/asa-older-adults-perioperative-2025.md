## Scope
New 2025 ASA practice advisory for optimizing perioperative care for older adults (typically defined as ≥65 years) undergoing inpatient surgery.

## Key Recommendations

### Preoperative Assessment
- **Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA)**: Consider a multidimensional assessment of medical, functional, cognitive, and psychosocial status.
- **Frailty Screening**: Screen for frailty using a validated tool (e.g., Clinical Frailty Scale, Fried phenotype). Frailty is a strong predictor of postoperative complications.
- **Cognitive Screening**: Baseline cognitive assessment is recommended to identify patients at high risk for postoperative delirium (POD) and postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD).
- **Medication Review**: Conduct a thorough review and deprescribe potentially inappropriate medications (referring to AGS Beers Criteria).

### Prehabilitation
- For elective surgeries, consider multimodal prehabilitation (exercise, nutrition, cognitive/psychological support) to optimize functional status before surgery.

### Intraoperative Management
- **Anesthetic Choice**: Regional anesthesia may reduce delirium risk compared to general anesthesia in some settings, though the evidence is not definitive.
- **Depth of Anesthesia Monitoring**: Processed EEG monitoring (e.g., BIS) may be considered to avoid excessive anesthetic depth.
- **Avoid Potentially Inappropriate Medications**: Minimize use of long-acting benzodiazepines and anticholinergic agents.

### Postoperative Care
- **Delirium Prevention**: Implement multicomponent non-pharmacologic strategies (HELP protocol), including reorientation, sleep promotion, early mobilization, and sensory aids (glasses, hearing aids).
- **Early Mobilization**: Encourage early and progressive mobilization to reduce functional decline.
- **Pain Management**: Use multimodal analgesia, minimizing reliance on opioids.

### Discharge Planning
- Initiate discharge planning early, involving geriatric specialists, physical therapy, and social work as needed.
