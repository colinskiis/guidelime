## Scope
Modular update of the 2017 ASA practice guidelines for preoperative fasting, addressing carbohydrate-containing clear liquids, chewing gum, and pediatric fasting duration.

## Key Recommendations

### Clear Liquids

#### Standard Fasting Time
| Patient Group | Fasting Duration |
|---------------|------------------|
| Adults | 2 hours before elective procedures |
| Children | 2 hours before elective procedures |

#### Carbohydrate-Containing Clear Liquids
| Recommendation | Details |
|----------------|---------|
| Adults without delayed gastric emptying | May consume up to 2 hours before procedure |
| Volume | Up to 400 mL reasonable for most adults |
| Carbohydrate content | Typically 50g carbohydrate in 400 mL |

#### Protein-Containing Clear Liquids
- Limited evidence available
- May follow same 2-hour fasting guideline as other clear liquids
- Clinical judgment required

### Solids

#### Minimum Fasting Times
| Food Type | Fasting Duration |
|-----------|------------------|
| Light meal | 6 hours |
| Fried/fatty foods | 8 hours or longer |
| Meat | 8 hours or longer |

#### Light Meal Definition
- Toast with clear liquids
- Clear soup
- Crackers

### Chewing Gum

#### Preoperative Gum Chewing
| Finding | Recommendation |
|---------|----------------|
| Gastric volume effect | Minimal impact |
| Gastric pH effect | Not clinically significant |
| Recommendation | Elective procedures need not be delayed |

### Pediatric Considerations

#### Clear Liquids - Children
| Age Group | Fasting Duration |
|-----------|------------------|
| All children | 2 hours |
| Previous 3-hour recommendation | Now reduced to 2 hours |

#### Breast Milk
| Fasting Duration | Age |
|------------------|-----|
| 4 hours | All infants |

#### Infant Formula
| Fasting Duration | Notes |
|------------------|-------|
| 6 hours | Unchanged from prior guidelines |

#### Solids - Children
| Fasting Duration | Food Type |
|------------------|-----------|
| 6 hours | Light meal |
| 8 hours | Fatty/fried foods |

### Special Populations

#### Delayed Gastric Emptying
| Condition | Consideration |
|-----------|---------------|
| Diabetes with gastroparesis | Extended fasting may be needed |
| GLP-1 receptor agonists | Consider drug effects on gastric emptying |
| Obesity | Case-by-case assessment |
| Neuromuscular disorders | Extended fasting may be needed |

#### GLP-1 Receptor Agonist Use
| Concern | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Delayed gastric emptying | Significant with these medications |
| Elective surgery | Consider holding medication |
| Full stomach precautions | May be warranted |

### Emergency Procedures

#### Considerations
- Fasting status often unknown
- Full stomach precautions appropriate
- Risk-benefit assessment required
- Rapid sequence induction may be indicated

### Medications

#### Preoperative Medications
| Category | Recommendation |
|----------|----------------|
| Antacids | May be given with sip of water |
| H2 blockers | Consider in high-risk patients |
| Prokinetics | Limited evidence for routine use |

### Goals of Fasting Guidelines

#### Primary Objectives
- Minimize aspiration risk
- Prevent pulmonary aspiration pneumonia
- Maintain patient comfort
- Avoid excessive fasting

#### Balance Considerations
- Gastric volume reduction
- Patient satisfaction
- Metabolic considerations
- Dehydration prevention

### Exceptions and Modifications

#### Conditions Requiring Extended Fasting
- Bowel obstruction
- Esophageal disorders (achalasia, stricture)
- Previous gastric surgery
- Active GERD with aspiration risk
- Trauma with recent oral intake

### Practical Implementation

#### Patient Instructions
| Timing | Instructions |
|--------|--------------|
| Night before | Last solid meal timing |
| Morning of surgery | Clear liquids until 2 hours before |
| Medications | Usually with sip of water |
