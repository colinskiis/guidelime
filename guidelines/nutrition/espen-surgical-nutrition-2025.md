## Scope
Comprehensive 2025 update of the ESPEN guideline on perioperative nutritional management, encompassing prehabilitation, intraoperative care, and postoperative recovery for surgical patients.

## Key Recommendations

### Risk Assessment and Screening
- **Mandatory Screening**: All surgical patients should be screened for malnutrition risk using validated tools (e.g., NRS-2002, MUST) prior to surgery.
- **Frailty and Sarcopenia**: Recommends assessment for frailty (e.g., frailty phenotype, 5-times sit-to-stand test) and sarcopenia (e.g., CT-based skeletal muscle index) in patients undergoing major surgery.

### Prehabilitation
- **Multimodal Prehab**: A combination of nutritional optimization, physical exercise, and anxiety reduction (trimodal prehabilitation) is recommended before major surgery, particularly for patients with malnutrition or low functional capacity.
- **Duration**: Ideally 4–6 weeks prior to elective surgery.

### Perioperative Nutrition
- **Oral Nutrition Supplements (ONS)**: Recommended for malnourished patients or those at risk, starting preoperatively and continuing postoperatively.
- **Immunonutrition**: Perioperative immunonutrition (formulas containing arginine, omega-3 fatty acids, and nucleotides) is recommended for 5–7 days preoperatively in patients undergoing major abdominal cancer surgery.
- **Fasting**: Minimize preoperative fasting. Clear fluids up to 2 hours before anesthesia and solid food up to 6 hours before are recommended where there are no contraindications.

### Postoperative Nutrition
- **Early Oral Feeding**: Recommends early oral/enteral intake (within 1–2 days post-surgery) as part of ERAS protocols for most elective GI surgeries.
- **Parenteral Nutrition (PN)**: Reserved for patients who cannot meet nutritional needs via the enteral route (e.g., <50% of energy goal by day 7), or when the oral/enteral route is contraindicated (e.g., bowel obstruction).

### Monitoring
- Monitor nutritional intake, weight, and functional status throughout the perioperative period.
