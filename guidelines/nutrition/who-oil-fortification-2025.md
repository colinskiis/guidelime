## Scope
Global recommendations on the fortification of edible oils and fats with vitamins A and D as a public health strategy to improve the nutritional status of populations at risk of deficiency.

## Key Recommendations

### Fortification with Vitamin A
- **Recommendation**: Fortification of edible oils and fats with vitamin A should be considered in regions where vitamin A deficiency is a public health problem.
- **Goal**: To reduce the prevalence of subclinical vitamin A deficiency and its associated morbidity (e.g., xerophthalmia, increased infection risk).

### Fortification with Vitamin D
- **Recommendation**: Fortification of edible oils and fats with vitamin D is suggested as an effective means to increase vitamin D intake and improve serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels.
- **Target Populations**: Especially beneficial in regions with limited sunlight exposure or high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency/ricket.

### Implementation and Monitoring
- **Technical Feasibility**: Edible oils are excellent vehicles for fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K) due to their stability and widespread consumption.
- **Monitoring**: National monitoring of vitamin levels in the oil and nutritional status in the population is essential to ensure safety and efficacy.
- **Quality Control**: Robust regulatory and quality assurance systems must be in place at the manufacturing level.

### Integrated Approach
- Fortification should be part of a broader nutritional strategy that includes:
  - Dietary diversification.
  - Supplementation for high-risk groups (e.g., infants, pregnant women).
  - Public health education.

### Safety
- **Upper Limits**: Fortification levels should be carefully calculated to avoid exceeding the Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for vitamins A and D, especially in young children.
