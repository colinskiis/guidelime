## Scope
Practical and partially revised guideline for clinical nutrition in critically ill patients, based on the 2019 ESPEN guideline with updated recommendations.

## Key Recommendations

### General Principles

#### Malnutrition Risk
- Every critically ill patient staying >48 hours in ICU should be considered at risk for malnutrition
- Early assessment essential
- Nutritional therapy as core component of care

### Nutritional Assessment

#### Initial Evaluation
| Component | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Nutritional screening | Within 24-48 hours of ICU admission |
| Body composition | Consider if available |
| Energy expenditure | Indirect calorimetry preferred |
| Protein needs | Assess based on illness severity |

#### Malnutrition Diagnosis
- Use validated criteria (GLIM, ASPEN)
- Document baseline nutritional status
- Reassess during ICU stay

### Energy Requirements

#### Methods of Determination
| Method | Recommendation |
|--------|----------------|
| Indirect calorimetry | Preferred when available |
| Predictive equations | Alternative; less accurate |
| Weight-based estimates | 20-25 kcal/kg/day acute phase |

#### Phases of Critical Illness
| Phase | Energy Target |
|-------|---------------|
| Acute (Day 1-2) | Low-calorie start |
| Early (Day 3-7) | Progressive increase toward target |
| Late (>Day 7) | Aim for full requirements |

### Protein Requirements

#### Recommendations
| Patient Group | Protein Target |
|---------------|----------------|
| General ICU | 1.3 g/kg/day progressively |
| Renal failure (no RRT) | 0.8-1.0 g/kg/day |
| Renal failure (with RRT) | 1.5-2.0 g/kg/day |
| Burns | Up to 2.0 g/kg/day |

### Route of Nutrition

#### Enteral Nutrition Priority
| Recommendation | Details |
|----------------|---------|
| Timing | Start within 48 hours if hemodynamically stable |
| Route preference | EN preferred over PN |
| Gastric feeding | Acceptable first-line approach |
| Post-pyloric | If high aspiration risk or gastric intolerance |

#### When to Use Parenteral Nutrition
| Indication | Timing |
|------------|--------|
| EN contraindicated | Early PN initiation |
| EN insufficient | Supplemental PN after 3-7 days |
| EN failure | Transition to PN |

### Specific Nutrients

#### Lipids
| Recommendation | Details |
|----------------|---------|
| Fat provision | Part of non-protein calories |
| Fish oil | Not routinely recommended |
| Lipid-based formulas | Consider in selected patients |

#### Micronutrients
| Recommendation | Details |
|----------------|---------|
| Trace elements | Provide daily requirements |
| Vitamins | Ensure adequate supplementation |
| Thiamine | Consider early in at-risk patients |
| Selenium | No high-dose supplementation |

#### Glutamine
- Not recommended routinely in ICU patients
- May be considered in specific populations

### Special Populations

#### Obese Patients
| BMI | Energy | Protein |
|-----|--------|---------|
| 30-50 | Hypocaloric feeding | 1.2-2.0 g/kg ideal weight |
| >50 | 11-14 kcal/kg actual weight | Higher protein needs |

#### Sepsis/Septic Shock
| Phase | Recommendation |
|-------|----------------|
| Resuscitation | Delay nutrition until stable |
| Stabilization | Low-dose EN when stable |
| Recovery | Progress to full requirements |

#### Acute Pancreatitis
| Severity | Recommendation |
|----------|----------------|
| Mild | Oral diet as tolerated |
| Moderate-severe | EN within 24-72 hours |
| Route | Gastric or jejunal acceptable |

#### Post-Surgical
| Recommendation | Details |
|----------------|---------|
| Early EN | Within 24 hours when possible |
| Enhanced recovery | Integrate with ERAS protocols |

### Monitoring

#### Parameters
| Parameter | Frequency |
|-----------|-----------|
| Tolerance | Daily assessment |
| Gastric residuals | Not routinely required |
| Glucose control | Regular monitoring |
| Triglycerides | If receiving lipids |
| Refeeding markers | Phosphate, potassium, magnesium |

#### Refeeding Syndrome Prevention
- Identify at-risk patients
- Start with low-calorie intake
- Supplement phosphate, potassium, magnesium
- Monitor closely during advancement

### Mechanical Ventilation

#### Considerations
| Status | Recommendation |
|--------|----------------|
| Intubated | EN preferred |
| NIV | EN can be given carefully |
| Weaning | Adequate nutrition supports weaning |
| Extubation | Assess swallowing before oral |

### Long-Stay ICU Patients

#### Recommendations
- Reassess nutritional needs regularly
- Consider higher protein targets
- Address muscle wasting
- Transition planning to ward/rehabilitation
