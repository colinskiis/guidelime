## Scope
Evidence-based recommendations for nutrition support therapy in adult critically ill patients, updating the 2016 ASPEN/SCCM guidelines.

## Key Recommendations

### Methodology
- GRADE process used for all recommendations
- Only included studies meeting rigorous scientific criteria
- Focused on studies from 2001-2020 reflecting modern ICU practices
- No consensus recommendations included

### Energy Provision

#### Higher vs Lower Energy Dose
| Aspect | Recommendation |
|--------|----------------|
| Outcome comparison | No significant difference in clinical outcomes |
| Current evidence | Insufficient to recommend specific caloric target |
| Clinical judgment | Required for individual patient decisions |

#### Indirect Calorimetry
- Consider for determining energy needs
- Predictive equations have variable accuracy
- Avoid overfeeding and underfeeding

### Protein Provision

#### Higher vs Lower Protein Dose
| Finding | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Clinical outcomes | No significant differences identified |
| Optimal dose | Remains uncertain |
| Current practice | 1.2-2.0 g/kg/day commonly used |

### Enteral vs Parenteral Nutrition

#### Route Selection
| Comparison | Findings |
|------------|----------|
| Isocaloric PN vs EN | No difference in clinical outcomes |
| EN preference | Still recommended when GI tract functional |
| Early EN | Within 24-48 hours if hemodynamically stable |

#### Supplemental Parenteral Nutrition
- SPN plus EN vs EN alone: No difference in outcomes
- May consider if EN insufficient after 7-10 days
- Individual patient assessment needed

### Lipid Injectable Emulsions

#### Mixed-Oil vs Soybean Oil ILEs
- No significant differences in clinical outcomes
- Either option acceptable

#### Fish Oil-Containing ILEs
| Comparison | Results |
|------------|---------|
| FO-containing vs non-FO ILE | No significant outcome differences |
| Routine use | Not supported by current evidence |
| Clinical decision | Based on patient factors |

### Timing of Nutrition

#### Early Enteral Nutrition
| Timing | Recommendation |
|--------|----------------|
| Initiation | Within 24-48 hours of ICU admission |
| Hemodynamic stability | Required before initiation |
| Vasopressor use | Not absolute contraindication |

### Gastric Residual Volume

#### Monitoring
- Routine monitoring not universally recommended
- High GRV threshold (≥500 mL) if monitored
- Clinical assessment important

### Special Populations

#### Obesity
| BMI Category | Energy Target |
|--------------|---------------|
| BMI 30-50 | 11-14 kcal/kg actual weight |
| BMI >50 | 22-25 kcal/kg ideal body weight |
| Protein | 2.0-2.5 g/kg ideal body weight |

#### Pancreatitis
- Early EN safe and recommended
- Gastric or post-pyloric feeding acceptable
- PN if EN not feasible

#### Burns
- Increased energy needs (25-30 kcal/kg)
- High protein requirements (1.5-2 g/kg)
- Micronutrient supplementation

### Practical Considerations

#### Barriers to EN
- Hemodynamic instability
- High-dose vasopressors
- GI dysfunction/intolerance
- Abdominal surgery

#### Monitoring
| Parameter | Frequency |
|-----------|-----------|
| Tolerance | Daily |
| Nutritional adequacy | Weekly |
| Metabolic parameters | As indicated |

### Key Changes from 2016

#### Methodology Updates
- More rigorous study selection
- GRADE methodology throughout
- No consensus-based recommendations

#### Clinical Implications
- Less prescriptive targets
- Greater emphasis on clinical judgment
- Individualized approach emphasized
