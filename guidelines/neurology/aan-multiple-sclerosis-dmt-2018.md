# AAN Practice Guideline: Disease-Modifying Therapies for Adults with Multiple Sclerosis

## Scope
Evidence-based recommendations for starting, switching, and stopping disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) in adults with multiple sclerosis (MS).

## Key Recommendations

### Starting DMT

#### When to Start (Strong)
- Offer DMT to patients with relapsing forms of MS
- Includes clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) with MRI suggesting MS
- Discuss benefits and risks

#### Counseling Requirements
| Topic | Discussion Points |
|-------|-------------------|
| Benefits | Reduce relapses, slow disability, reduce MRI lesions |
| Risks | Drug-specific adverse effects |
| Monitoring | Required testing and follow-up |
| Pregnancy | Family planning considerations |
| Adherence | Importance of consistent use |

### Available DMTs

#### Injectable Therapies
| Drug | Mechanism | Dosing |
|------|-----------|--------|
| Interferon beta-1a (Avonex) | Immunomodulatory | 30 mcg IM weekly |
| Interferon beta-1a (Rebif) | Immunomodulatory | 44 mcg SC 3x weekly |
| Interferon beta-1b (Betaseron) | Immunomodulatory | 250 mcg SC every other day |
| Glatiramer acetate | Immunomodulatory | 20 mg SC daily or 40 mg 3x weekly |
| Peginterferon beta-1a | Immunomodulatory | 125 mcg SC every 2 weeks |

#### Oral Therapies
| Drug | Mechanism | Dosing |
|------|-----------|--------|
| Fingolimod | S1P modulator | 0.5 mg daily |
| Teriflunomide | DHODH inhibitor | 14 mg daily |
| Dimethyl fumarate | Nrf2 activator | 240 mg twice daily |
| Siponimod | S1P modulator | Titrated to 2 mg daily |
| Cladribine | Purine analog | Pulsed dosing per protocol |
| Ozanimod | S1P modulator | 0.92 mg daily |
| Ponesimod | S1P modulator | 20 mg daily |
| Diroximel fumarate | Nrf2 activator | 462 mg twice daily |

#### Infusion Therapies
| Drug | Mechanism | Dosing |
|------|-----------|--------|
| Natalizumab | Anti-α4 integrin | 300 mg IV every 4 weeks |
| Ocrelizumab | Anti-CD20 | 600 mg IV every 6 months |
| Alemtuzumab | Anti-CD52 | 2 courses 12 months apart |
| Ofatumumab | Anti-CD20 | 20 mg SC monthly |
| Ublituximab | Anti-CD20 | 450 mg IV every 6 months |

### Choosing a DMT

#### Factors to Consider
| Factor | Considerations |
|--------|----------------|
| Disease activity | Higher activity may warrant more effective therapy |
| Risk tolerance | Some DMTs have serious but rare risks |
| Convenience | Route, frequency of administration |
| Monitoring burden | Required testing varies |
| Family planning | Pregnancy category, washout time |
| Cost | Insurance coverage, patient assistance |
| Comorbidities | May affect drug choice |

#### Higher vs. Lower Efficacy
- No direct head-to-head trials comparing all DMTs
- Some evidence suggests higher efficacy of natalizumab, ocrelizumab, alemtuzumab
- Balance efficacy against safety risks

### Switching DMT

#### Indications for Switching
- Breakthrough disease activity (relapses, new MRI lesions)
- Intolerable side effects
- Adherence difficulties
- Safety concerns (e.g., PML risk with natalizumab)

#### Switching Recommendations
| Scenario | Recommendation |
|----------|----------------|
| Suboptimal response | Switch to different mechanism/higher efficacy |
| Intolerance | Switch within or between classes |
| Safety concern | Switch based on specific risk |

### Stopping DMT

#### Consider Stopping When
- Stable disease for extended period
- Advanced progressive MS with no inflammatory activity
- Serious adverse effects
- Patient preference after informed discussion

#### Stopping Considerations
- Discuss risks of rebound or disease worsening
- Monitor closely after discontinuation
- Some drugs require gradual discontinuation

### Monitoring

#### General Monitoring
- MRI at baseline and periodically (typically annually)
- Clinical assessment every 3-12 months
- Drug-specific laboratory monitoring

#### JC Virus and PML Risk
- Anti-JCV antibody testing before and during natalizumab
- Higher risk: JCV positive, prior immunosuppression, >2 years use
- Extended interval dosing may reduce risk

### Special Populations

#### Pregnancy
- Many DMTs contraindicated in pregnancy
- Glatiramer acetate: Safest profile
- Discuss family planning before starting DMT
- Washout periods vary by drug

#### Older Adults
- Consider comorbidities
- May have lower disease activity
- Discuss benefit-risk balance

#### Progressive MS
- Ocrelizumab FDA-approved for primary progressive MS
- Siponimod approved for secondary progressive MS
- Fewer options with proven efficacy

### Patient Education
- Nature of MS and DMT goals
- Importance of adherence
- Recognizing relapses
- When to contact provider
- Support resources
