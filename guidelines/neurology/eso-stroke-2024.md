## Scope
2024 European Stroke Organisation guideline update on the acute management of ischemic stroke, including intravenous thrombolysis and endovascular thrombectomy.

## Key Recommendations

### Stroke Unit Care
- All stroke patients should be admitted to a dedicated stroke unit for comprehensive multidisciplinary care.

### Intravenous Thrombolysis (IVT)

#### Time Window
- **0-4.5 Hours**: IV alteplase (0.9 mg/kg, max 90 mg, 10% bolus + 60 min infusion) is strongly recommended.
- **4.5-9 Hours (Wake-Up Stroke / Unknown Onset)**: IVT may be considered if DWI-FLAIR mismatch on MRI suggests tissue salvageability.

#### Tenecteplase
- Tenecteplase (0.25 mg/kg, max 25 mg) is an acceptable alternative to alteplase, with easier single-bolus administration.

### Endovascular Thrombectomy (EVT)

#### Standard Window (0-6 Hours)
- EVT is strongly recommended for patients with large vessel occlusion (ICA, M1, proximal M2) and significant neurological deficit.

#### Extended Window (6-24 Hours)
- EVT can be performed in select patients meeting imaging criteria (e.g., DAWN, DEFUSE-3 trials – clinical-core mismatch or target mismatch).

#### Bridging vs. Direct EVT
- IVT followed by EVT (bridging therapy) remains the standard approach. Direct EVT without prior IVT may be considered in select situations but is not routinely preferred.

### Blood Pressure Management
- Avoid aggressive BP lowering acutely unless >185/110 before thrombolysis or >220/120 in non-thrombolysis patients with specific indications.

### Aspirin
- Start aspirin 160-325 mg within 24-48 hours of stroke onset (but >24 hours after IVT).
