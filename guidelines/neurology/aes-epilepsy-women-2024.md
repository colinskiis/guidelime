## Scope
2024 AES guideline addressing the unique management considerations for epilepsy in women across the reproductive lifespan.

## Key Recommendations

### Preconception Counseling
- Discuss pregnancy planning with all women of childbearing potential at the time of epilepsy diagnosis and periodically.
- **Folic Acid**: High-dose supplementation (1-4 mg/day) is recommended before conception and during the first trimester.
- Optimize seizure control before conception.

### ASM Selection in Women of Childbearing Potential
- **Avoid Valproate**: Strongly contraindicated due to high risk of major congenital malformations (MCMs) and neurodevelopmental effects. Avoid in all women who may become pregnant unless no alternative.
- **Preferred ASMs**: Lamotrigine and levetiracetam have the most reassuring safety data in pregnancy.
- **Other Considerations**: Topiramate carries increased MCM risk (cleft lip/palate); carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital have moderate risk.

### Contraception
- Enzyme-inducing ASMs (phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, primidone, oxcarbazepine, eslicarbazepine, topiramate at high doses) reduce efficacy of hormonal contraceptives.
- Recommend non-hormonal methods (IUD, barrier) or high-dose hormonal methods with backup.

### Pregnancy Management
- Monitor ASM serum levels, especially for lamotrigine and levetiracetam, as levels can drop significantly.
- Dose adjustments may be needed to maintain seizure control.
- High-resolution fetal ultrasound for structural abnormalities.

### Catamenial Epilepsy
- Seizures related to menstrual cycle hormonal fluctuations.
- Consider cyclic clobazam, acetazolamide, or adjustments to baseline ASM around menses.

### Menopause
- Seizure patterns may change; consider reassessing ASM needs.
