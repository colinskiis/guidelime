## Scope
2024 AAN practice guideline update on the selection and use of disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) for multiple sclerosis.

## Key Recommendations

### Starting DMT
- Offer DMT to patients with relapsing forms of MS (clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting MS, active secondary progressive MS).
- Early initiation of DMT slows disability progression.

### DMT Selection (Risk-Benefit Discussion)

#### Platform / Moderate-Efficacy Therapies
- **Interferons (Avonex, Rebif, Betaseron, Plegridy)**, **Glatiramer Acetate (Copaxone, Glatopa)**: Established safety; modest efficacy.
- **Dimethyl Fumarate (Tecfidera), Diroximel Fumarate (Vumerity)**, **Teriflunomide (Aubagio)**: Oral options.

#### High-Efficacy Therapies (Consider Early for Active Disease)
- **Natalizumab (Tysabri)**: High efficacy; requires JC virus antibody monitoring (PML risk).
- **Ocrelizumab (Ocrevus)**: Anti-CD20; approved for RRMS and PPMS. May be first-line for active or aggressive disease.
- **Ofatumumab (Kesimpta)**: Anti-CD20; self-administered SC.
- **Alemtuzumab (Lemtrada)**: High efficacy; significant side effect profile (autoimmunity); reserved for highly active disease.
- **Cladribine (Mavenclad)**: Oral; high efficacy; used in highly active RRMS.
- **Ublituximab (Briumvi)**: Anti-CD20.

#### S1P Receptor Modulators
- **Fingolimod (Gilenya), Siponimod (Mayzent), Ozanimod (Zeposia), Ponesimod (Ponvory)**: Oral; first-dose monitoring; cardiac, macular edema, infection risks.

### Escalation vs. Early High-Efficacy
- Evidence supports early high-efficacy therapy (anti-CD20, natalizumab) in patients with active/aggressive MS for better long-term outcomes.
- Shared decision-making; consider patient preferences, comorbidities, JCV status, family planning.

### Monitoring
- Clinical relapses, MRI activity, disability progression (EDSS).
- Regular safety labs per specific DMT requirements.

### Switching DMT
- Switch if breakthrough activity (relapses, new MRI lesions) or intolerance.
