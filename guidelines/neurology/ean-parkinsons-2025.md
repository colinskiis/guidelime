## Scope
Updated evidence-based recommendations from the EAN for the diagnosis, early management, and advanced stage treatment of Parkinson's Disease (PD).

## Key Recommendations

### Diagnosis and Biomarkers
- **Clinical Diagnosis**: Still based on the presence of bradykinesia plus at least one of (resting tremor or rigidity).
- **DAT Scan**: Recommended only when the clinical diagnosis is uncertain (e.g., differentiating PD from essential tremor).
- **New Biomarkers**: Recommends the consideration of alpha-synuclein seed amplification assays (alpha-syn SAA) in research or specialized clinical settings to help confirm diagnosis in early or atypical cases.

### Early Management
- **Levodopa**: Still the most effective treatment for motor symptoms. Recommends starting levodopa early to improve quality of life and functional independence.
- **Dopamine Agonists (DAs)**: Especially in younger patients (<60y), DAs can be considered to delay levodopa-related motor complications, though patients must be screened for impulse control disorders.
- **MAO-B Inhibitors**: Effective for mild motor symptoms.

### Management of Motor Complications
- **Optimizing Levodopa**: Use fractional dosing or add-on therapies (COMT inhibitors, MAO-B inhibitors, or Amantadine) to reduce "off" time.
- **Advanced Therapies**: For patients with significant motor fluctuations not controlled by oral medications:
  - **Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS)**: Strong recommendation for well-selected patients with levodopa-responsive symptoms.
  - **Levodopa-Carbidopa Intestinal Gel (LCIG)** or Continuous Subcutaneous Apomorphine Infusion.

### Non-Motor Symptoms (NMS)
- **Depression/Anxiety**: Routine screening and treatment with SSRIs/SNRIs or CBT.
- **Cognitive Impairment**: Cholinesterase inhibitors (e.g., Rivastigmine) are recommended for PD dementia.
- **Autonomic Dysfunction**: Systematic management of orthostatic hypotension, constipation, and urinary issues.

### Neuroprotection and Lifestyle
- **Exercise**: Strong recommendation for regular physical activity (at least 150 minutes per week) to improve motor function and potentially slow progression.
- **Education**: Empower patients and caregivers with information about the progressive nature of the disease and available supportive resources.
