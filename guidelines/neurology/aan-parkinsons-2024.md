## Scope
2024 AAN practice guideline update on the pharmacological and surgical treatment of Parkinson disease (PD).

## Key Recommendations

### Initial Pharmacotherapy

#### Levodopa (with Carbidopa)
- Most effective symptomatic therapy.
- Can be used as initial therapy, especially in patients with significant disability.
- Motor fluctuations (wearing-off, dyskinesias) may develop with long-term use.

#### Dopamine Agonists (Pramipexole, Ropinirole, Rotigotine)
- Alternative initial therapy, especially in younger patients (may delay dyskinesias).
- Side effects: impulse control disorders (gambling, hypersexuality), sedation, hallucinations.

#### MAO-B Inhibitors (Selegiline, Rasagiline, Safinamide)
- Mild symptomatic benefit; may be used as initial monotherapy for mild symptoms or as adjunct.

### Motor Fluctuations ("Off" Episodes)
- **Adjust Levodopa**: Increase frequency or dose.
- **Add Adjunctive Therapies**: COMT inhibitors (entacapone, opicapone), MAO-B inhibitors, dopamine agonists.
- **Extended-Release Levodopa Formulations** (Rytary, Duodopa).
- **Istradefylline (Adenosine A2A Antagonist)**: May reduce off-time.
- **On-Demand Rescue Therapies**: Inhaled levodopa (Inbrija), sublingual apomorphine (Kynmobi), subcutaneous apomorphine injection.

### Dyskinesias
- Amantadine (extended-release preferred): Only approved medication for levodopa-induced dyskinesias.
- Reduce levodopa dose if tolerable.

### Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS)
- Indicated for patients with motor fluctuations and dyskinesias refractory to medical optimization.
- Typically targets subthalamic nucleus (STN) or globus pallidus interna (GPi).
- Improves motor symptoms and allows reduction of medications.

### Non-Motor Symptoms
- Address depression, anxiety, psychosis, cognitive impairment, sleep disorders, constipation, orthostatic hypotension with targeted therapies.

### Physical and Occupational Therapy
- Exercise improves motor function and quality of life.
