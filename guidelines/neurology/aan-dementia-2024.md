## Scope
2024 AAN practice guideline update on the evaluation and management of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia, including Alzheimer disease.

## Key Recommendations

### Evaluation
- Obtain a thorough history (patient and informant), cognitive testing (e.g., MoCA, Mini-Cog, MMSE), and neurological examination.
- **Labs**: Rule out reversible causes: TSH, B12, CBC, CMP. Consider RPR, HIV if risk factors.
- **Neuroimaging**: MRI brain preferred to exclude structural causes (stroke, tumor, hydrocephalus) and assess atrophy pattern.
- **Biomarkers**: Amyloid PET or CSF Aβ42/tau may be used to confirm Alzheimer pathology in atypical or unclear cases, or for disease-modifying therapy eligibility.

### Pharmacotherapy for Alzheimer Disease

#### Cholinesterase Inhibitors
- Donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine are recommended for mild-to-moderate Alzheimer disease. Modest symptomatic benefit.

#### Memantine
- NMDA receptor antagonist. May be added for moderate-to-severe Alzheimer disease.

#### Anti-Amyloid Monoclonal Antibodies
- **Lecanemab (Leqembi)**: FDA approved for early Alzheimer disease (MCI or mild dementia due to AD) with confirmed amyloid pathology. Slows cognitive and functional decline. Requires amyloid PET or CSF confirmation; regular MRI monitoring for ARIA (amyloid-related imaging abnormalities).
- **Donanemab**: Under FDA review; similar mechanism.

### Non-Pharmacological Management
- Cognitive stimulation, exercise, social engagement.
- Occupational therapy for functional adaptation.
- Advance care planning.

### Caregiver Support
- Assess caregiver burden. Refer to support resources (Alzheimer's Association, respite care).
