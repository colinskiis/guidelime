# IHS Global Practice Recommendations for Acute Pharmacological Treatment of Migraine

## Scope
Global practice recommendations for the acute pharmacological treatment of migraine in adults, designed for all clinical settings including those with limited resources.

## Key Recommendations

### Principles of Acute Treatment
- Treat early in the attack
- Use adequate doses
- Choose route of administration based on symptoms
- Avoid medication overuse
- Individualize treatment

### First-Line Treatments

#### Simple Analgesics
| Drug | Dose | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| Acetaminophen | 1000 mg | Effective for mild-moderate attacks |
| Aspirin | 900-1000 mg | Can combine with metoclopramide |
| Ibuprofen | 400-600 mg | First-line NSAID |
| Naproxen sodium | 500-550 mg | Longer duration of action |
| Diclofenac potassium | 50-100 mg | Rapid-release formulation |

#### Optimal Use
- Take at onset of headache phase
- Adequate hydration
- Limit use to ≤15 days/month (simple analgesics)
- Limit use to ≤10 days/month (combination analgesics)

### Triptans

#### If Analgesics/NSAIDs Fail (Strong)
Switch to a triptan for subsequent attacks rather than repeating ineffective treatment

#### Available Triptans
| Triptan | Oral Dose | Peak Effect | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Sumatriptan | 50-100 mg | 2-4 hours | Also available as SC, nasal |
| Rizatriptan | 10 mg | 1-1.5 hours | Fast onset |
| Eletriptan | 40-80 mg | 2 hours | Higher efficacy |
| Zolmitriptan | 2.5-5 mg | 2-3 hours | Also nasal spray |
| Naratriptan | 2.5 mg | 2-3 hours | Longer half-life, gentler |
| Frovatriptan | 2.5 mg | 4 hours | Longest half-life |
| Almotriptan | 12.5 mg | 2 hours | Good tolerability |

#### Triptan + NSAID Combination
- **Sumatriptan 50-100 mg + Naproxen sodium 550 mg** recommended if triptan alone insufficient
- More effective than either alone

#### Triptan Non-Response
- Try at least 3 different triptans before concluding class failure
- Consider alternative formulations (nasal, SC)

### CGRP Receptor Antagonists (Gepants)

#### Acute Treatment Options
| Drug | Dose | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| Rimegepant | 75 mg | ODT formulation, once daily |
| Ubrogepant | 50-100 mg | May repeat after 2 hours |
| Zavegepant | 10 mg nasal | Rapid onset |

#### Advantages
- No cardiovascular contraindications
- No risk of medication overuse headache
- Can use in patients who cannot take triptans

### Lasmiditan (5-HT1F Agonist)
- 50-100-200 mg oral
- No vasoconstriction (CV-safe)
- Causes dizziness; no driving for 8 hours
- Schedule V controlled substance (US)

### Anti-Emetics

#### For Nausea and Gastric Stasis
| Drug | Dose | Route |
|------|------|-------|
| Metoclopramide | 10 mg | PO, IM, IV |
| Domperidone | 10 mg | PO |
| Prochlorperazine | 10 mg | PO, PR, IM |

- Improve gastric motility and oral medication absorption
- Have independent analgesic effect
- Give before or with other acute medications

### Severe/Refractory Attacks

#### Parenteral Options
- Sumatriptan 6 mg SC
- Ketorolac 30-60 mg IM/IV
- Metoclopramide 10-20 mg IV
- Prochlorperazine 10 mg IV
- Dexamethasone 4-8 mg IV (reduces recurrence)

### Special Populations

#### Menstrual Migraine
- Short-term NSAID prophylaxis (perimenstrual)
- Consider frovatriptan for mini-prophylaxis

#### Pregnancy
- Acetaminophen first-line
- Avoid NSAIDs (especially third trimester)
- Triptans: Sumatriptan has most safety data
- Metoclopramide safe for nausea

#### Cardiovascular Disease
- Avoid triptans and ergots
- Gepants and lasmiditan are alternatives
- NSAIDs with caution

### Medication Overuse Prevention
| Drug Class | Maximum Days/Month |
|------------|-------------------|
| Simple analgesics | ≤15 days |
| Triptans | ≤10 days |
| Opioids | ≤10 days |
| Combination analgesics | ≤10 days |

### Not Recommended
- Opioids (not first-line; reserve for refractory cases)
- Butalbital combinations (high abuse potential)
- Ergotamine (limited efficacy, more side effects than triptans)
