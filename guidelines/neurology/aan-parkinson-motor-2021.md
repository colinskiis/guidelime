# AAN Practice Guideline: Dopaminergic Therapy for Motor Symptoms in Early Parkinson Disease

## Scope
Evidence-based recommendations for dopaminergic therapy in early Parkinson disease, including levodopa, dopamine agonists, and MAO-B inhibitors.

## Key Recommendations

### General Principles

#### Treatment Goals
- Improve motor symptoms and quality of life
- Maintain function and independence
- Minimize adverse effects
- Individualize therapy based on patient factors

#### When to Initiate Treatment
- When symptoms cause functional impairment
- Patient preference regarding symptom control
- No evidence that early treatment is neuroprotective

### Levodopa

#### Efficacy (Strong)
- Most effective medication for motor symptoms
- Superior to dopamine agonists and MAO-B inhibitors
- First-line for significant motor disability

#### Formulations
| Formulation | Notes |
|-------------|-------|
| Carbidopa/levodopa IR | Standard formulation |
| Carbidopa/levodopa CR | Extended release |
| Carbidopa/levodopa ER capsules | Rytary |
| Carbidopa/levodopa intestinal gel | Advanced disease |

#### Dosing
- Start low: Carbidopa/levodopa 25/100 mg TID
- Titrate based on response
- Ensure adequate carbidopa (≥75 mg/day)

#### Motor Complications
- Wearing off
- Dyskinesias
- On-off fluctuations
- Risk increases with duration and dose

### Dopamine Agonists

#### Available Agents
| Agent | Dosing | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Pramipexole | 0.125-1.5 mg TID | Non-ergot |
| Ropinirole | 0.25-8 mg TID | Non-ergot |
| Rotigotine | 2-8 mg/24h patch | Transdermal |

#### Efficacy
- Less effective than levodopa for motor symptoms
- Lower risk of motor complications
- May be initial therapy in younger patients

#### Adverse Effects
- Impulse control disorders (gambling, hypersexuality, shopping)
- Excessive daytime sleepiness
- Hallucinations
- Edema
- Nausea

#### Counseling Requirements (Strong)
- Warn ALL patients about impulse control disorders
- Document discussion
- Monitor throughout treatment

### MAO-B Inhibitors

#### Available Agents
| Agent | Dosing | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Rasagiline | 0.5-1 mg daily | |
| Selegiline | 5 mg BID | Avoid evening doses |
| Safinamide | 50-100 mg daily | Adjunct only |

#### Efficacy
- Modest symptomatic benefit
- May be used as monotherapy in early/mild disease
- Adjunct to levodopa

#### Considerations
- Generally well tolerated
- Dietary restrictions minimal with selective MAO-B
- Drug interactions (serotonin syndrome with certain medications)

### Comparative Effectiveness

#### Levodopa vs. Dopamine Agonists
| Factor | Levodopa | Dopamine Agonist |
|--------|----------|------------------|
| Motor symptom control | Superior | Moderate |
| Motor complications | Higher risk | Lower risk |
| Psychiatric effects | Lower | Higher (ICD, hallucinations) |
| Age consideration | Preferred in elderly | Consider in younger |

### Initial Treatment Selection

#### Factors to Consider
| Factor | Favors Levodopa | Favors DA/MAO-B |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Age | >70 years | <70 years |
| Cognitive impairment | Yes | No |
| Symptom severity | Significant | Mild |
| Risk of motor complications | Acceptable | Avoid if possible |
| Impulse control risk | Lower | Higher |

### Special Populations

#### Elderly Patients
- Levodopa preferred
- Avoid dopamine agonists (hallucinations, confusion)
- Lower starting doses

#### Patients with Cognitive Impairment
- Levodopa first-line
- Avoid dopamine agonists
- Monitor for confusion

### Adjunctive Therapies

#### When to Add Therapy
- Wearing off or inadequate response
- Consider before significantly increasing levodopa

#### Options
- Add MAO-B inhibitor
- Add dopamine agonist (with caution)
- Add COMT inhibitor
- Adjust levodopa dosing frequency

### Monitoring

#### Regular Assessment
- Motor symptoms (UPDRS)
- Non-motor symptoms
- Medication side effects
- Impulse control behaviors
- Quality of life

### Patient Education
- Chronic progressive condition
- Medications control symptoms, not disease-modifying
- Side effect monitoring
- Importance of regular follow-up
