## Scope
2025 update to the AAN/IRLSSG guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of restless legs syndrome (RLS) in adults.

## Key Recommendations

### Diagnosis
- **Clinical Diagnosis**: RLS is diagnosed based on the presence of an urge to move the legs, usually accompanied by uncomfortable sensations, that begins or worsens during rest, is relieved by movement, and occurs predominantly in the evening or at night.
- **Serum Ferritin**: Check serum ferritin levels in all patients. Low iron stores (ferritin <75 mcg/L) are a common and treatable contributor.

### First-Line Treatment: Iron Therapy
- **Iron Repletion**: For patients with serum ferritin <75 mcg/L, oral or IV iron supplementation is recommended as first-line therapy.
- **Target Ferritin**: Aim for a level of >100-200 mcg/L.

### Pharmacotherapy (When Iron is Sufficient or Repletion Fails)
Preference has shifted away from dopamine agonists due to the risk of augmentation.
- **Alpha-2-Delta Ligands (Preferred)**: Gabapentin enacarbil, gabapentin, or pregabalin are now recommended as first-line pharmacotherapy for RLS, as they carry a lower risk of augmentation.
- **Dopamine Agonists (Second-Line)**: Pramipexole, ropinirole, or rotigotine may be used but require careful monitoring for augmentation (worsening of symptoms, earlier onset, or spread to other body parts).

### Management of Augmentation
- If augmentation occurs on a dopamine agonist, the recommended approach is to:
  1. Rule out and treat iron deficiency.
  2. Gradually discontinue the dopamine agonist.
  3. Transition to an alpha-2-delta ligand.

### Refractory RLS
- For patients with severe symptoms not controlled by first- and second-line agents, low-dose opioids (e.g., oxycodone, methadone) may be considered under careful supervision due to risk of dependence.

### Non-pharmacologic Therapies
- Regular moderate exercise, sleep hygiene, and avoidance of RLS-exacerbating substances (e.g., caffeine, alcohol, antihistamines) are recommended as adjuncts.
