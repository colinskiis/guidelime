## Scope
First AAN guideline dedicated to the management of functional seizures (formerly PNES), providing evidence-based recommendations for diagnosis, communication, and multi-disciplinary treatment.

## Key Recommendations

### Diagnosis
- **Definitive Diagnosis**: Video-electroencephalography (vEEG) captured during a typical event remains the gold standard.
- **Semiology**: Neurologists should use characteristic semiological features (e.g., asynchronous movements, eye closure, duration >2 mins) to support the diagnosis, but vEEG is preferred for confirmation.

### Communication of Diagnosis
- **Urgent Communication**: The diagnosis should be communicated clearly, respectfully, and without delay.
- **Framework**: Use a transparent approach, explaining what the condition *is* (a functional disorder of brain networks) rather than just what it *is not* (epileptic).
- **Empathy**: Emphasize that the seizures are real and distressing, and that effective treatments exist.

### Pharmacological Management
- **Antiseizure Medications (ASMs)**: Recommend **against** the use of ASMs specifically for treating functional seizures.
- **Tapering**: If functional seizures are confirmed and the patient is on ASMs (without co-occurring epilepsy), a gradual supervised taper should be planned.
- **Benzodiazepines**: Do not recommend the chronic use of benzodiazepines for the management of functional seizures.

### Psychological Interventions
- **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)**: Strong recommendation for CBT-based psychotherapy, which has shown the strongest evidence for reducing seizure frequency and improving quality of life.
- **Psychological Assessment**: All patients should be screened for comorbid psychiatric conditions (e.g., PTSD, anxiety, depression) which may require parallel treatment.

### Multi-disciplinary Care
- **Collaboration**: Recommends a coordinated care approach involving the neurologist, psychiatrist/psychotherapist, and primary care physician.
- **Primary Care Role**: Ensuring long-term follow-up and management of comorbidities once the diagnosis is stabilized.

### Education and Support
- **Patient Education**: Provide educational materials that explain Functional Neurological Disorder (FND) and functional seizures.
- **Support Groups**: Consider referral to specialized support networks.
