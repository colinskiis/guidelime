# AAN/AES/SMFM Practice Guideline: Antiseizure Medications in Pregnancy

## Scope
Evidence-based recommendations regarding effects of antiseizure medications (ASMs) and folic acid on major congenital malformations (MCMs), adverse perinatal outcomes, and neurodevelopmental outcomes in children born to people with epilepsy.

## Key Recommendations

### Major Congenital Malformations

#### High-Risk Medications
| Medication | MCM Risk | Recommendation |
|------------|----------|----------------|
| Valproate | Significantly elevated | Avoid during pregnancy if possible |
| Phenobarbital | Elevated risk | Consider alternatives |
| Topiramate | Elevated risk (oral clefts) | Counsel regarding risks |
| Phenytoin | Elevated risk | Consider alternatives |

#### Lower-Risk Medications
| Medication | MCM Risk | Notes |
|------------|----------|-------|
| Lamotrigine | Lowest documented risk | Preferred option |
| Levetiracetam | Low risk | Commonly used in pregnancy |
| Oxcarbazepine | Relatively lower risk | Acceptable alternative |

#### Dose-Dependent Effects
| Medication | Finding |
|------------|---------|
| Valproate | Risk increases with dose; avoid >600 mg/day |
| Topiramate | Higher doses associated with greater risk |
| Lamotrigine | No clear dose-response for MCM |
| Carbamazepine | Higher doses may increase risk |

### Specific Malformation Risks

#### Valproate
| Malformation Type | Association |
|-------------------|-------------|
| Neural tube defects | Strong association |
| Cardiac defects | Increased risk |
| Oral clefts | Increased risk |
| Hypospadias | Increased risk |
| Limb defects | Increased risk |

#### Topiramate
| Malformation Type | Association |
|-------------------|-------------|
| Oral clefts | Significantly increased |
| Other MCMs | Potentially increased |

### Neurodevelopmental Outcomes

#### Valproate Exposure
| Outcome | Risk |
|---------|------|
| Developmental delay | Increased |
| Lower IQ | Documented (dose-related) |
| Autism spectrum disorder | Increased risk |
| ADHD | Increased risk |
| Language delay | Documented |

#### Other ASMs
| Medication | Neurodevelopmental Concern |
|------------|---------------------------|
| Phenobarbital | Potential cognitive effects |
| Topiramate | Insufficient data, possible concerns |
| Lamotrigine | No significant increase identified |
| Levetiracetam | No significant increase identified |

### Perinatal Outcomes

#### Small for Gestational Age
| Medication | Risk |
|------------|------|
| Topiramate | Increased |
| Zonisamide | Possibly increased |
| Other ASMs | Limited data |

#### Preterm Birth
- Mixed evidence across ASMs
- Monitor pregnancy closely

### Folic Acid Supplementation

#### Recommendations
| Aspect | Recommendation |
|--------|----------------|
| General | All childbearing potential: folic acid supplementation |
| Dose | Higher doses may be recommended with ASM use |
| Timing | Begin before conception |
| Effect on MCM | May reduce risk, especially neural tube defects |

### Preconception Counseling

#### Key Points
| Topic | Discussion |
|-------|------------|
| Medication review | Assess necessity, consider changes |
| Monotherapy | Preferred over polytherapy |
| Lowest effective dose | Optimize before pregnancy |
| Valproate alternatives | Strongly encourage |
| Folic acid | Initiate prior to conception |
| Contraception | Until ASM regimen optimized |

### Management During Pregnancy

#### Medication Adjustments
| Medication | Pregnancy Consideration |
|------------|------------------------|
| Lamotrigine | Levels may decrease; monitor and adjust |
| Levetiracetam | Levels may decrease; monitor and adjust |
| Oxcarbazepine | Monitor levels |
| Valproate | If continued, use lowest effective dose |

#### Monitoring
| Parameter | Frequency |
|-----------|-----------|
| ASM levels | Each trimester at minimum |
| Seizure frequency | Regular assessment |
| Fetal anatomy | Detailed ultrasound |
| Fetal growth | Serial monitoring |

### Breastfeeding

#### Considerations
| Medication | Breastfeeding |
|------------|---------------|
| Lamotrigine | Generally compatible |
| Levetiracetam | Generally compatible |
| Valproate | Generally compatible |
| Phenobarbital | Monitor infant for sedation |
| Primidone | Monitor infant for sedation |

### Shared Decision-Making

#### Principles
- Balance seizure control with fetal risk
- Individualize recommendations
- Document discussions
- Involve maternal-fetal medicine as appropriate
- Consider epilepsy severity and history
