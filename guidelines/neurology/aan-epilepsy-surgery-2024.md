## Scope
2024 AAN/AES practice guideline update on the referral, evaluation, and surgical management of drug-resistant epilepsy.

## Key Recommendations

### Definition of Drug-Resistant Epilepsy (DRE)
- Failure of adequate trials of ≥2 appropriately chosen and tolerated antiseizure medications (ASMs) to achieve sustained seizure freedom.
- ~30-40% of patients with epilepsy develop DRE.

### Early Referral to Epilepsy Center
- Patients with DRE should be referred to a comprehensive epilepsy center for surgical evaluation.
- Delay in surgery is associated with worse outcomes. Median time from epilepsy diagnosis to surgery is often >20 years – this should be shortened.

### Presurgical Evaluation
- **Video-EEG Monitoring**: To capture seizures and localize seizure onset zone.
- **High-Resolution MRI (Epilepsy Protocol)**: Identify structural lesions (MTS, tumor, FCD, cavernoma).
- **Neuropsychological Testing**: Assess cognitive function and lateralization.
- **PET, SPECT, MEG**: Adjunct modalities for localization in MRI-negative cases.
- **Invasive EEG (SEEG, Grids)**: For cases needing further localization.

### Surgical Options

#### Resective Surgery
- **Temporal Lobectomy**: For mesial temporal sclerosis or temporal lobe epilepsy. ~60-70% achieve seizure freedom.
- **Lesionectomy**: For MRI-visible lesions.
- **Lobectomy/Corticectomy**: For extratemporal epilepsy.

#### Non-Resective Options
- **Laser Interstitial Thermal Therapy (LITT)**: Minimally invasive ablation.
- **Responsive Neurostimulation (RNS)**: For patients not candidates for resection.
- **Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS)**: Palliative; reduces seizure frequency.
- **Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS)**: ANT-DBS for DRE.

### Outcomes
- Surgery offers significant improvement in seizure control and quality of life compared to continued ASM management alone.
