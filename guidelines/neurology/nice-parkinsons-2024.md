## Scope

This guideline provides updated recommendations for the diagnosis and management of Parkinson's disease in adults, covering pharmacological, surgical, and supportive therapies.

## Key Recommendations

### Diagnosis
- Clinical diagnosis based on bradykinesia plus rigidity, tremor, or postural instability
- Specialist referral for diagnosis (untreated within 6 weeks)
- Consider DaTscan if diagnostic uncertainty
- Exclude red flags (poor levodopa response, early falls, autonomic failure)

### Pharmacological Treatment - Motor Symptoms
**Early Disease:**
- Levodopa: Most effective for motor symptoms
- Dopamine agonists: Consider for younger patients (motor complication reduction)
- MAO-B inhibitors: Modest symptom control, well tolerated

**Adjunct Therapy (Wearing Off/Fluctuations):**
- COMT inhibitors (entacapone, opicapone)
- MAO-B inhibitors (rasagiline, safinamide)
- Dopamine agonists
- Amantadine for dyskinesias

### Non-Motor Symptoms
- Depression: SSRIs, SNRIs, consider pramipexole
- Psychosis: Reduce anti-parkinsonian drugs, then quetiapine or clozapine
- Dementia: Rivastigmine
- REM sleep behavior disorder: Clonazepam or melatonin
- Orthostatic hypotension: Non-pharmacologic first, then fludrocortisone/midodrine

### Advanced Therapies
- Deep brain stimulation: Motor complications despite optimized medication
- Levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG): For selected patients
- Subcutaneous apomorphine infusion

### Multidisciplinary Care
- Access to Parkinson's specialist nurse
- Physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech and language therapy
- Palliative care involvement in advanced stages

### Driving Advice
- Inform DVLA of diagnosis
- Assess driving fitness periodically
