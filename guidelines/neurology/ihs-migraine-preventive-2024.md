# IHS Global Practice Recommendations for Preventive Pharmacological Treatment of Migraine

## Scope
Global practice recommendations for preventive pharmacological treatment of migraine in adults, applicable across different care settings worldwide.

## Key Recommendations

### Indications for Preventive Therapy
- ≥4 migraine days per month
- Significant disability despite acute treatment
- Contraindication to or failure of acute treatments
- Medication overuse or risk thereof
- Patient preference

### Goals of Prevention
- Reduce attack frequency by ≥50%
- Reduce attack severity and duration
- Improve response to acute treatment
- Reduce disability
- Prevent medication overuse

### First-Line Oral Preventives

#### Beta-Blockers
| Drug | Dose Range | Notes |
|------|------------|-------|
| Propranolol | 40-240 mg/day | Level A evidence |
| Metoprolol | 50-200 mg/day | Level A evidence |
| Atenolol | 50-100 mg/day | Less evidence |

- Contraindicated in asthma, bradycardia, hypotension
- Monitor for fatigue, exercise intolerance

#### Antiepileptics
| Drug | Dose Range | Notes |
|------|------------|-------|
| Topiramate | 50-200 mg/day | Level A evidence; weight loss |
| Valproate | 500-1500 mg/day | Level A; avoid in women of childbearing potential |

- Topiramate: Cognitive effects, paresthesias, kidney stones
- Valproate: Weight gain, teratogenicity

#### Antidepressants
| Drug | Dose Range | Notes |
|------|------------|-------|
| Amitriptyline | 10-150 mg/day | Level A; also helps tension-type headache |
| Venlafaxine | 75-150 mg/day | Level B evidence |

- Amitriptyline: Sedation, dry mouth, weight gain
- Take at bedtime

#### Calcium Channel Blockers
| Drug | Dose Range | Notes |
|------|------------|-------|
| Flunarizine | 5-10 mg/day | Not available in US |
| Verapamil | 240-480 mg/day | Less evidence |

### CGRP Monoclonal Antibodies

#### Available Agents
| Drug | Route | Dosing | Target |
|------|-------|--------|--------|
| Erenumab | SC | 70-140 mg monthly | CGRP receptor |
| Fremanezumab | SC | 225 mg monthly or 675 mg quarterly | CGRP ligand |
| Galcanezumab | SC | 240 mg loading, then 120 mg monthly | CGRP ligand |
| Eptinezumab | IV | 100-300 mg quarterly | CGRP ligand |

#### Advantages of CGRP mAbs
- Migraine-specific mechanism
- Favorable tolerability
- No titration needed
- Monthly or quarterly dosing
- No significant drug interactions

#### Considerations
- Higher cost
- Long-term safety data still accumulating
- Constipation with erenumab
- Injection site reactions

### Gepants for Prevention

#### Oral CGRP Antagonists
| Drug | Dose | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| Atogepant | 60 mg daily | FDA approved for prevention |
| Rimegepant | 75 mg every other day | Dual acute and preventive use |

- No cardiovascular contraindications
- Generally well tolerated
- May cause nausea

### Treatment Duration and Assessment

#### Trial Duration
- Adequate trial: 2-3 months at target dose
- Assess efficacy before switching

#### Discontinuation
- Consider after 6-12 months of good control
- Gradual taper preferred
- May restart if attacks recur

### Chronic Migraine (≥15 days/month)

#### OnabotulinumtoxinA
- 155-195 units every 12 weeks
- 31 injection sites (head/neck)
- FDA approved for chronic migraine
- Effect may take 2-3 cycles

#### Combination Therapy
- May combine oral preventive + CGRP mAb
- May combine oral preventive + onabotulinumtoxinA
- Individualize based on response and tolerability

### Special Populations

#### Women of Childbearing Potential
- Avoid valproate
- Avoid topiramate if possible
- Beta-blockers generally acceptable
- CGRP mAbs: Limited pregnancy data

#### Elderly
- Lower starting doses
- Monitor for drug interactions
- Avoid tricyclics if falls risk

#### Comorbidities
| Comorbidity | Preferred | Avoid |
|-------------|-----------|-------|
| Depression | Amitriptyline, venlafaxine | — |
| Anxiety | Amitriptyline, venlafaxine | — |
| Hypertension | Beta-blockers | — |
| Obesity | Topiramate | Valproate, amitriptyline |
| Epilepsy | Topiramate, valproate | — |

### Non-Pharmacologic Approaches
- Cognitive behavioral therapy
- Biofeedback
- Relaxation techniques
- Regular sleep, exercise, hydration
- Avoid triggers

### Monitoring
- Headache diary (frequency, intensity, acute medication use)
- Assess disability (MIDAS, HIT-6)
- Regular follow-up to adjust therapy
