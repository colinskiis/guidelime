# AHA/ASA Guidelines for the Early Management of Patients with Acute Ischemic Stroke

## Scope
Evidence-based recommendations for early management of acute ischemic stroke (AIS), including thrombolysis, thrombectomy, and supportive care.

## Key Recommendations

### Emergency Evaluation

#### Imaging (Class I)
- **Non-contrast CT**: All patients before any treatment
- **CT angiography (CTA)**: If thrombectomy candidate (LVO suspected)
- Do not delay IV alteplase for CTA if otherwise eligible

#### Time Targets
- Door-to-imaging: ≤25 minutes
- Door-to-needle (IV thrombolysis): ≤60 minutes
- Door-to-puncture (thrombectomy): ≤90 minutes

### Intravenous Thrombolysis (Alteplase)

#### Eligibility (Class I)
- Onset within **4.5 hours**
- No contraindications
- Measurable neurological deficit

#### Standard Dosing
- **Alteplase 0.9 mg/kg** (max 90 mg)
- 10% as bolus, remainder over 60 minutes

#### Time Windows
| Time Window | Recommendation |
|-------------|----------------|
| 0-3 hours | Strongly recommended (Class I) |
| 3-4.5 hours | Recommended for eligible patients (Class I) |
| Wake-up or unknown onset | May be considered if MRI shows tissue salvageable (Class IIa) |

#### Tenecteplase
- May be considered as alternative to alteplase (Class IIb)
- Single bolus dosing (0.25 mg/kg)

### Mechanical Thrombectomy

#### Indications (Class I)
- Large vessel occlusion (ICA, M1)
- NIHSS ≥6
- ASPECTS ≥6
- Pre-stroke mRS 0-1
- Within **6 hours** of symptom onset

#### Extended Window (6-24 hours)
- Eligible if meets **DAWN** or **DEFUSE-3** criteria
- Clinical-core mismatch on perfusion imaging
- Must have target mismatch profile

#### Key Points
- Do NOT delay thrombectomy for observation after IV thrombolysis
- IV thrombolysis should be given if eligible, but proceed directly to thrombectomy

### Blood Pressure Management

#### Before Thrombolysis
- Lower BP to <185/110 mmHg before alteplase
- Maintain <180/105 mmHg for 24 hours after

#### No Thrombolysis
- Permissive hypertension (allow up to 220/120 mmHg)
- Lower if >220/120 mmHg or end-organ damage

### Glucose Management
- Treat hyperglycemia (target 140-180 mg/dL)
- Avoid hypoglycemia (<60 mg/dL)

### Antiplatelet Therapy
- Aspirin 325 mg within 24-48 hours of stroke onset (Class I)
- Delay 24 hours after IV thrombolysis

### Anticoagulation
- Not recommended acutely for most strokes
- Hold anticoagulation for 24 hours after thrombolysis

### Fever
- Treat hyperthermia (>38°C)
- Antipyretics and identify source

### DVT Prophylaxis
- Intermittent pneumatic compression (Class I)
- Pharmacologic prophylaxis after 24-48 hours if immobile

## Stroke Systems of Care
- Primary stroke centers (PSC) for IV thrombolysis
- Comprehensive stroke centers (CSC) for thrombectomy
- Transfer protocols for LVO patients at non-thrombectomy centers
