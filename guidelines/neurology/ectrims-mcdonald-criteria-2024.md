## Scope
2024 revision to the McDonald diagnostic criteria for multiple sclerosis (MS), providing updated guidance for earlier and more accurate diagnosis using new biomarkers.

## Key Changes

### New Biomarkers
- **Central Vein Sign (CVS)**: The presence of a central vein within MS lesions on MRI is now incorporated as supportive evidence for diagnosis, helping distinguish MS from its mimics.
- **Paramagnetic Rim Lesions (PRL)**: These chronic active lesions, identified on advanced MRI, are recognized as a feature of MS pathology.
- **Kappa Free Light Chains (κFLC)**: Elevated kappa free light chains in CSF are now accepted as an alternative to oligoclonal bands for demonstrating intrathecal immunoglobulin synthesis.

### Optic Nerve
- The **optic nerve** is now recognized as a fifth anatomical location for demonstrating dissemination in space (DIS), in addition to the periventricular, juxtacortical/cortical, infratentorial, and spinal cord regions.

### Application Across Ages
- The revised criteria now apply the same diagnostic framework for **both children and adults**.

### Radiologically Isolated Syndrome (RIS)
- The criteria provide guidance for individuals incidentally found to have MS-like lesions on MRI without clinical symptoms, acknowledging RIS as being on the MS spectrum.

### Goals
- **Earlier Diagnosis**: Enabling clinicians to diagnose MS sooner, which can lead to earlier treatment initiation and potentially better long-term outcomes.
- **Improved Specificity**: The new biomarkers aim to reduce misdiagnosis by differentiating MS from conditions that can mimic it on MRI.
