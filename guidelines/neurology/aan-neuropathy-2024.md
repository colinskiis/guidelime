## Scope
2024 AAN practice guideline update on the evaluation and treatment of distal symmetric polyneuropathy (DSP).

## Key Recommendations

### Evaluation
- **Clinical Assessment**: Length-dependent sensory symptoms (numbness, tingling, burning), distal weakness, loss of reflexes.
- **Laboratory Testing**:
  - Initial: Fasting glucose or HbA1c, B12, TSH, CBC, CMP.
  - If unclear etiology: Serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP), immunofixation, additional vitamins (B1, B6, folate), HIV, Lyme (endemic areas).
- **Electrodiagnostic Studies (NCS/EMG)**: Confirm neuropathy, characterize pattern, rule out other conditions. Not required if clinical diagnosis is clear.
- **Skin Biopsy (IENFD)**: For suspected small-fiber neuropathy with normal NCS.
- **Genetic Testing**: Consider for suspected hereditary neuropathy (CMT).

### Common Etiologies
- **Diabetic Neuropathy**: Most common cause.
- **Prediabetes/Metabolic Syndrome**.
- **Alcohol**.
- **B12 Deficiency**.
- **Chemotherapy-Induced**.
- **Idiopathic**: ~30% of cases.

### Treatment

#### Address Underlying Cause
- Glycemic control for diabetic neuropathy.
- B12 supplementation for deficiency.
- Alcohol cessation.

#### Symptomatic Treatment (Neuropathic Pain)
- **Gabapentin, Pregabalin**: First-line; effective for neuropathic pain.
- **Duloxetine**: SNRI; FDA-approved for diabetic neuropathic pain.
- **Amitriptyline, Nortriptyline**: TCAs; effective but more side effects.
- **Topical Capsaicin, Lidocaine Patches**: Adjuncts for localized pain.
- **Tramadol**: Second-line; opioid-like agent.
- Combination therapy may be required.

### Physical and Occupational Therapy
- Balance training, fall prevention, assistive devices.
