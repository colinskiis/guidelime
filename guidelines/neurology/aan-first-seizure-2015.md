# AAN/AES Guideline: Management of an Unprovoked First Seizure in Adults

## Scope
Evidence-based recommendations for prognosis assessment and treatment decisions in adults presenting with an unprovoked first seizure.

## Key Recommendations

### Recurrence Risk (Level A)
Adults presenting with an unprovoked first seizure should be informed that:
- Risk of seizure recurrence is **greatest in first 2 years** (21-45%)
- Most recurrences occur within first year
- After 2 years without seizure, risk decreases substantially

### Factors Increasing Recurrence Risk (Level A)
- **Prior brain insult**: Stroke, trauma, CNS infection
- **EEG with epileptiform abnormalities**
- **Significant brain imaging abnormality**
- **Nocturnal seizure**

Patients with these risk factors have recurrence rates of **60% or higher**.

### Treatment Decisions

#### Immediate AED Therapy (Level B)
- Likely to **reduce seizure recurrence** in the 2 years after first seizure
- Does NOT improve long-term remission rates or quality of life

#### Deferred Treatment (Level C)
- May be considered when patient is informed of risks/benefits
- Acceptable approach if patient prefers to wait
- Does not worsen long-term prognosis

### Driving Recommendations
- Patients should be counseled about driving restrictions
- Laws vary by jurisdiction
- Generally advised not to drive until seizure-free for specified period

### When to Treat Immediately
Consider immediate AED therapy if:
- Patient has high-risk features (above)
- Patient desires treatment
- Risk of recurrence unacceptable to patient
- Seizure during safety-critical activities (driving, operating machinery)

### When Deferring Treatment is Reasonable
- Low recurrence risk factors
- Patient informed and prefers observation
- Ability to monitor and reassess

## Antiepileptic Drug Selection
- Not specified in this guideline
- See AAN/AES guideline on "Efficacy and Tolerability of New Antiepileptic Drugs"

## Follow-Up
- EEG recommended if not already obtained
- Brain MRI if not already done
- Reassess if additional seizures occur

## Important Notes
- Guideline addresses UNPROVOKED seizures only
- Provoked seizures (metabolic, drug-related) managed differently
- Reaffirmed in February 2024 as still valid
