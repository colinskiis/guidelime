## Scope

This guideline provides recommendations for the medical management of moderate to severe luminal Crohn's disease in adults.

## Key Recommendations

### Induction Therapy - Biologic-Naïve
**Strong Recommendations:**
- TNF inhibitors (infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab pegol)
- IL-12/23 inhibitors (ustekinumab)
- Vedolizumab (integrin inhibitor)

**Conditional Recommendations:**
- Risankizumab (IL-23 inhibitor)
- Combination therapy (anti-TNF + immunomodulator) over monotherapy

### Induction Therapy - Anti-TNF Experienced
- Ustekinumab
- Risankizumab
- Vedolizumab
- Consider alternative TNF inhibitor if primary response

### Maintenance Therapy
- Continue inducing agent for maintenance
- Avoid corticosteroid-dependent maintenance
- Immunomodulator monotherapy generally not preferred

### Small Molecule Therapies
- Upadacitinib (JAK inhibitor): Effective for induction and maintenance
- Consider after biologic failure
- Monitor for safety signals (VTE, infections, malignancy)

### Corticosteroids
- For short-term induction only
- Taper once remission achieved
- Not for maintenance

### Treatment Approach
**Treat-to-Target:**
- Aim for clinical + endoscopic remission
- Monitor with biomarkers (CRP, fecal calprotectin)
- Adjust therapy based on objective measures

### Combination vs. Monotherapy
- Combination therapy (anti-TNF + thiopurine/MTX) improves outcomes
- Reduces immunogenicity
- Consider patient risk profile

### Therapeutic Drug Monitoring
- Proactive TDM during maintenance may improve outcomes
- Reactive TDM for loss of response
- Optimize drug levels before switching
