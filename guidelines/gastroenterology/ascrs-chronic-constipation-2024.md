## Scope
2024 update for the systematic evaluation and evidence-based management of chronic constipation in adults, including slow transit constipation (STC) and dyssynergic defecation (DD).

## Key Recommendations

### Diagnosis
- **Rome IV Criteria**: Used for diagnosing functional constipation.
- **Alarm Features**: Colonoscopy is recommended for patients with alarm symptoms (rectal bleeding, weight loss, anemia, new onset >50y) to exclude organic pathology.
- **Anorectal Physiology Testing**: High-resolution anorectal manometry (HRAM) and balloon expulsion test (BET) are recommended to identify dyssynergic defecation.
- **Colonic Transit Study**: Recommended for patients not responding to initial therapy to differentiate normal transit from slow transit constipation.

### Initial Medical Management
- **Fiber and Lifestyle**: First-line treatment includes dietary fiber supplementation (e.g., psyllium), adequate hydration, and regular exercise.
- **Osmotic Laxatives**: Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is a well-established and safe first-line agent.
- **Stimulant Laxatives**: (e.g., Bisacodyl, Senna) effective for short-term or intermittent use.

### Second-Line Pharmacotherapy
- **Secretagogues**: Linaclotide, Plecanatide, or Lubiprostone are recommended for patients not responding to first-line laxatives.
- **Prokinetics**: Prucalopride (a 5-HT4 agonist) is effective for slow transit constipation.

### Management of Dyssynergic Defecation
- **Biofeedback Therapy**: Strongly recommended as the first-line treatment for dyssynergic defecation. It is effective in improving symptoms and quality of life.

### Surgical Management
- **Colectomy with Ileorectal Anastomosis (IRA)**: May be considered for highly selected patients with confirmed, refractory slow transit constipation who have failed all medical therapy and have **documented absence of dyssynergic defecation**.
