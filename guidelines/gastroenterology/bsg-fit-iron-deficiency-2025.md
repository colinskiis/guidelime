## Scope
New 2025 clinical guideline addressing the integration of Faecal Immunochemical Testing (FIT) into the diagnostic pathway for patients presenting with iron deficiency anemia (IDA) to prioritize endoscopic investigations.

## Key Recommendations

### Use of FIT in IDA
- **Recommendation**: FIT should be used as a triage tool in non-urgent/urgent (but non-emergency) cases of IDA to help determine the priority of lower GI investigation (colonoscopy or qFIT-guided CT).
- **Threshold**: A FIT result ≥10 µg Hb/g faeces is considered positive and warrants urgent lower GI evaluation.

### Triage Logic
- **FIT Positive (≥10 µg Hb/g)**: High priority for colonoscopy or CT colonography, as the probability of colorectal cancer (CRC) is significantly higher.
- **FIT Negative (<10 µg Hb/g)**: The risk of CRC is low (~0.1-0.5%). These patients may still require investigation if clinical suspicion is high or for other symptoms, but they can be managed with lower urgency for colonic imaging.

### Upper GI Investigation
- **Unchanged**: The use of FIT in IDA does **not** replace the need for upper GI investigation (e.g., gastroscopy) if indicated (e.g., patient >50y or with upper GI symptoms), as FIT does not reliably detect upper GI pathology.

### Coeliac Screening
- **Requirement**: All patients with IDA should continue to be screened for coeliac disease using IgA-tTG antibodies regardless of the FIT result.

### Implementation
- **Timing**: FIT should be performed ideally before or at the time of referral.
- **Communication**: Patients should be informed that a negative FIT result significantly reduces the likelihood of bowel cancer but does not completely exclude other causes of iron deficiency.

### Exclusion Criteria
- FIT should not be used as a triage tool in patients with overt rectal bleeding, as they require direct endoscopic evaluation regardless of the FIT result.
