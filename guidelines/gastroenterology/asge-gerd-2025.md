## Scope
Comprehensive 2025 update of the ASGE guideline for the role of endoscopy in the diagnosis and management of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).

## Key Recommendations

### Indications for Endoscopy
- **EGD Recommended**: For patients with GERD and alarm symptoms (dysphagia, odynophagia, weight loss, anemia, GI bleeding).
- **EGD Recommended**: For patients with GERD symptoms for >5-10 years to screen for Barrett's esophagus.
- **EGD Not Routinely Needed**: For diagnosis of uncomplicated, typical GERD symptoms without alarm features.

### Initial Management
- **Lifestyle Modifications**: Weight loss if overweight, avoiding food triggers, and elevation of the head of bed are first-line.
- **PPIs**: Empiric trial of once-daily PPI for 8 weeks is the standard initial pharmacologic treatment.

### Refractory GERD
- **Definition**: Persistent symptoms despite 8 weeks of optimized PPI therapy (BID dosing, taken 30-60 min before meals).
- **Approach**: EGD is recommended to evaluate for mucosal complications and exclude alternative diagnoses. Ambulatory pH or pH-impedance monitoring is recommended to confirm acid reflux burden.

### Endoscopic Antireflux Therapies
- **Transoral Incisionless Fundoplication (TIF)**: May be considered for PPI-responsive patients with objective evidence of GERD (e.g., LA Grade A-C esophagitis or abnormal pH testing) who wish to discontinue PPI therapy.
- **Radiofrequency Ablation (Stretta)**: The evidence for long-term symptom relief is limited; may be considered in select patients.
- **Magnetic Sphincter Augmentation (MSA) / LINX**: A surgical option for patients with objective GERD who are not candidates for or prefer an alternative to fundoplication.

### Barrett's Esophagus
- If Barrett's esophagus is found on screening EGD, follow surveillance protocols and consider ablation for dysplastic changes.
