## Scope

This guideline provides recommendations for the medical management of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis in adults.

## Key Recommendations

### Induction - Biologic-Naïve
**Strong Recommendations:**
- Infliximab (monotherapy or with thiopurine)
- Vedolizumab
- Ustekinumab

**Conditional Recommendations:**
- Adalimumab
- Golimumab
- Ozanimod (S1P modulator)
- Tofacitinib, upadacitinib (JAK inhibitors)

### Induction - Biologic-Experienced
- Upadacitinib
- Tofacitinib
- Vedolizumab
- Ustekinumab
- Different mechanism class preferred after failure

### Maintenance Therapy
- Continue same agent used for induction
- Optimizing therapy per drug levels/response

### Corticosteroids
- Short-term induction only
- Not for maintenance
- Budesonide MMX for mild-moderate as steroid-sparing

### Combination Therapy
- Anti-TNF + thiopurine: Higher efficacy, lower immunogenicity
- Consider in moderate-severe disease

### Treatment Approach
**Treat-to-Target:**
- Clinical remission + endoscopic healing
- Biomarkers (CRP, fecal calprotectin) for monitoring
- Adjust therapy based on objective measures

### Small Molecule Therapies
- JAK inhibitors: Effective but safety monitoring (VTE, infections, malignancy)
- S1P modulators (ozanimod, etrasimod): Cardiac monitoring at initiation

### Severe/Fulminant UC
- IV corticosteroids
- Infliximab or cyclosporine rescue therapy
- Surgical consultation early

### Colectomy
- Refractory to medical therapy
- Dysplasia/cancer
- Fulminant colitis not responding to medical therapy
