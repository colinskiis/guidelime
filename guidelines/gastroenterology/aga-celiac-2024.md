## Scope

This guideline provides updated recommendations for the diagnosis and management of celiac disease in adults and children.

## Key Recommendations

### Testing Indications
- GI symptoms: Chronic diarrhea, abdominal pain, bloating
- Extraintestinal manifestations: Iron deficiency anemia, osteoporosis, dermatitis herpetiformis
- At-risk groups: First-degree relatives, type 1 diabetes, autoimmune thyroid disease, Down syndrome

### Diagnostic Testing
- **Serology First:** IgA tissue transglutaminase (tTG-IgA) preferred
- Check total IgA to exclude IgA deficiency
- If IgA deficient: Use IgG-based assays (DGP-IgG)
- Test while on gluten-containing diet

### Biopsy
- Duodenal biopsy recommended to confirm diagnosis in adults
- Multiple biopsies from duodenal bulb and distal duodenum
- Histology: Villous atrophy, crypt hyperplasia, intraepithelial lymphocytosis
- Marsh classification for grading

### Serology-Based Diagnosis (Without Biopsy)
- Consider in children with very high tTG-IgA (>10x ULN) + positive EMA
- Adult no-biopsy approach not yet standard in US guidelines

### Treatment
- Strict lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD)
- Dietitian referral essential
- Education on cross-contamination
- Monitor adherence via serology

### Monitoring
- tTG-IgA at 6-12 months, then annually
- Monitor for nutritional deficiencies (iron, B12, folate, vitamin D, calcium)
- Bone density assessment at diagnosis
- Screen for associated autoimmune conditions

### Non-Responsive Celiac Disease
- Most common cause: Inadvertent gluten exposure
- Repeat biopsy if persistent symptoms despite GFD
- Rule out refractory celiac disease and enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma
