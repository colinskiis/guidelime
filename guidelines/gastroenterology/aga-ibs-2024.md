## Scope

This guideline provides recommendations for pharmacological management of irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C) in adults.

## Key Recommendations

### Diagnosis
- Rome IV criteria for IBS-C
- Exclude alarm features (blood in stool, weight loss, family history of CRC)
- Limited testing in typical presentations

### First-Line Pharmacotherapy
**Linaclotide (Strong Recommendation):**
- Guanylate cyclase-C agonist
- 290 mcg daily (IBS-C) or 72 mcg (chronic constipation)
- Take 30 min before breakfast

**Plecanatide (Strong Recommendation):**
- Guanylate cyclase-C agonist
- 3 mg daily

**Tenapanor (Conditional Recommendation):**
- NHE3 inhibitor
- 50 mg twice daily

### Second-Line Options
**Lubiprostone:**
- ClC-2 activator
- 8 mcg twice daily
- Consider if secretagogues contraindicated/not tolerated

**PEG-Based Laxatives:**
- For constipation component
- Limited evidence specifically for IBS-C

### Other Considerations
- Dietary fiber: Soluble fiber (psyllium) may help
- Probiotics: Insufficient evidence for routine use
- Antispasmodics: Hyoscine, dicyclomine for pain/cramping
- Neuromodulators: TCAs, SSRIs for global IBS symptoms

### Treatment Approach
- Start with lifestyle and dietary modifications
- Sequentially trial medications based on predominant symptoms
- Allow 4-8 weeks for therapeutic response
- Combination therapy may be needed

### Refractory IBS-C
- Consider specialist referral
- Evaluate for dyssynergic defecation (anorectal manometry)
- Biofeedback for pelvic floor dysfunction
