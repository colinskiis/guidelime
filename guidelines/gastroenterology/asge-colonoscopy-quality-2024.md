## Scope
Updated quality indicators for colonoscopy to measure and improve the quality of colonoscopy performance, reflecting new evidence since 2015.

## Key Recommendations

### Pre-Procedure Quality Indicators

#### Appropriate Indication
- Document appropriate indication for colonoscopy
- Follow screening/surveillance guidelines
- Target: ≥80% of procedures with documented appropriate indication

#### Informed Consent
- Discuss benefits, risks, alternatives
- Document in medical record
- Include sedation risks

#### Bowel Preparation Quality
- Use split-dose or same-day preparation
- Assess and document bowel prep quality
- Target: Adequate prep in ≥90% of cases

### Intra-Procedure Quality Indicators

#### Cecal Intubation Rate
| Population | Target |
|------------|--------|
| Screening colonoscopy | ≥95% |
| All colonoscopies | ≥90% |

- Photo-documentation of cecal landmarks
- Document reason if incomplete

#### Adenoma Detection Rate (ADR)
| Gender | Minimum Target | Preferred Target |
|--------|---------------|------------------|
| Overall | ≥25% | ≥30% |
| Men | ≥30% | ≥35% |
| Women | ≥20% | ≥25% |

- Calculated for screening colonoscopies ages 50+
- Single most important quality indicator

#### Withdrawal Time
- Minimum 6 minutes in negative colonoscopy
- Measured from cecum to anus
- Does not include intervention time

#### Serrated Polyp Detection Rate
- Target: ≥5% in screening colonoscopies
- Proximal serrated polyps particularly important

### Polypectomy Quality

#### Complete Polyp Resection
- Ensure complete removal of polyps
- Consider CARE or DISCARD criteria
- Photo-document before and after resection

#### Polyp Retrieval Rate
- Target: ≥90% of polyps retrieved for histology
- Document if polyp not retrieved and reason

#### Post-Polypectomy Bleeding
- Delayed bleeding rate: <1%
- Immediate bleeding controlled endoscopically

### Post-Procedure Quality Indicators

#### Perforation Rate
- Target: <1:1000 for screening colonoscopy
- <1:500 for all colonoscopies
- Document and track all perforations

#### Adverse Events Documentation
- Track all complications
- Include 30-day follow-up data
- Report serious adverse events

#### Appropriate Surveillance Recommendations
- Follow USMSTF surveillance guidelines
- Document recommended interval
- Communicate to patient and PCP

### Documentation Requirements

#### Procedure Report Elements
| Element | Required |
|---------|----------|
| Indication | Yes |
| Prep quality | Yes |
| Extent of examination | Yes |
| Findings | Yes |
| Interventions performed | Yes |
| Complications | Yes |
| Recommendations | Yes |

### Quality Improvement

#### Monitoring and Feedback
- Track individual endoscopist metrics
- Compare to benchmarks
- Provide regular feedback

#### Continuous Improvement
- Review cases with low-quality metrics
- Implement improvement strategies
- Re-measure after interventions

### Benchmarking

#### Priority Measures
| Indicator | Priority |
|-----------|----------|
| Adenoma detection rate | High |
| Cecal intubation rate | High |
| Bowel prep adequacy | High |
| Appropriate surveillance | High |
| Perforation rate | High |

### Special Considerations

#### Difficult Colonoscopy
- Document specific challenges
- Consider referral to experienced endoscopist
- Alternative imaging if incomplete

#### High-Risk Patients
- Increased vigilance for polyps
- More frequent surveillance if indicated
- Consider genetic evaluation
