## Scope
Major 2025 update to the ACG guideline for the management of Crohn's disease (CD) in adults, incorporating major advances in therapeutic options and a treat-to-target strategy.

## Key Recommendations

### Disease Classification and Prognosis
- **Montreal Classification**: Use to describe disease location (L1-L4) and behavior (B1-B3) to guide therapy.
- **Risk Stratification**: Early initiation of advanced therapy is recommended for patients with high-risk features (e.g., young age, perianal disease, deep ulcers, prior surgery).

### Treat-to-Target Strategy
- **Targets**: Clinical remission (CDAI <150 or PRO2 resolution), biomarker normalization (CRP, fecal calprotectin), and endoscopic healing (absence of ulceration) are the key targets.
- **Monitoring**: Objective assessment of inflammation (biomarkers, endoscopy, cross-sectional imaging) should guide treatment escalation.

### Induction Therapy
- **Anti-TNF Agents (Infliximab, Adalimumab, Certolizumab)**: Effective and well-established first-line advanced therapies.
- **Anti-IL-12/23 (Ustekinumab)** and **Anti-IL-23 (Risankizumab)**: Highly effective, with favorable safety profiles.
- **JAK Inhibitors (Upadacitinib)**: FDA-approved for CD; effective in biologic-experienced patients.

### Maintenance Therapy
- Patients who achieve remission with an induction agent should continue on that same agent for maintenance.
- **Combination Therapy**: An anti-TNF agent combined with an immunomodulator (e.g., azathioprine) is recommended to improve efficacy and reduce immunogenicity.

### Perianal Fistulizing Disease
- Anti-TNF agents (especially Infliximab) remain the best-studied therapies.
- Surgical drainage and seton placement should be performed before or in conjunction with medical therapy.

### Surgical Management
- Early referral to surgery is recommended for patients with obstructive strictures, abscess, or disease refractory to medical therapy.
