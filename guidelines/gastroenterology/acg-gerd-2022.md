# ACG Clinical Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of GERD

## Scope
Evidence-based recommendations for the evaluation and management of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), including pharmacologic, lifestyle, surgical, and endoscopic management.

## Key Recommendations

### Diagnosis
- **Clinical diagnosis**: Typical GERD symptoms (heartburn, regurgitation) can be diagnosed clinically
- **Endoscopy**: Not required for typical symptoms without alarm features
- **pH monitoring**: Recommended when diagnosis uncertain or before anti-reflux surgery
- **Ambulatory reflux monitoring**: Gold standard for documenting pathologic acid exposure

### Alarm Features Requiring Endoscopy
- Dysphagia
- Odynophagia
- Weight loss
- GI bleeding
- Anemia
- Persistent vomiting

### Pharmacologic Treatment

#### PPIs (Proton Pump Inhibitors)
- **First-line therapy** for erosive esophagitis and GERD symptoms
- Use lowest effective dose for maintenance
- Standard dose once daily initially, 30-60 minutes before breakfast
- Double-dose if inadequate response after 8 weeks

#### H2 Receptor Antagonists
- Alternative for mild, intermittent symptoms
- May be used as add-on for nocturnal symptoms

### Erosive Esophagitis by Grade
- **LA Grade A/B**: Minimum 8 weeks PPI, then step down
- **LA Grade C/D**: Indefinite maintenance PPI therapy OR anti-reflux surgery (Strong recommendation, moderate evidence)

### Lifestyle Modifications
- Weight loss if overweight/obese
- Avoid eating 2-3 hours before bedtime
- Head of bed elevation
- Avoid trigger foods (individualized)

### Surgical Options
- **Fundoplication**: Consider for patients with objective evidence of GERD who prefer surgery or have inadequate PPI response
- **Magnetic sphincter augmentation (LINX)**: Alternative to fundoplication
- Must confirm GERD objectively before surgery

### Refractory GERD
- Confirm diagnosis with pH/impedance monitoring
- Evaluate for other conditions (functional heartburn, eosinophilic esophagitis)
- Consider endoscopic or surgical options

## PPI Safety
- Long-term PPI use is generally safe when indicated
- Monitor for vitamin B12, magnesium in long-term users
- Benefits outweigh risks in patients with clear indications
