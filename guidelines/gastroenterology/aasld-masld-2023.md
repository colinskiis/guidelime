# AASLD Practice Guidance on Clinical Assessment and Management of NAFLD/MASLD

## Scope
Clinical guidance for assessment and management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), now termed metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD).

## Nomenclature Update (2023)
| Old Term | New Term |
|----------|----------|
| NAFLD | MASLD (Metabolic dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease) |
| NASH | MASH (Metabolic dysfunction-Associated Steatohepatitis) |

**MASLD definition**: Hepatic steatosis + at least one cardiometabolic risk factor (obesity, T2DM, hypertension, dyslipidemia, or prediabetes)

## Key Recommendations

### Screening and Diagnosis

#### Who to Screen
- Adults with obesity or type 2 diabetes
- Patients with unexplained elevated aminotransferases
- Incidental hepatic steatosis on imaging

#### Initial Assessment
- Exclude other causes of liver disease (alcohol, viral hepatitis, autoimmune)
- Calculate FIB-4 score for fibrosis risk stratification

### Fibrosis Risk Stratification

#### FIB-4 Score Thresholds
| FIB-4 Score | Risk | Action |
|-------------|------|--------|
| <1.3 | Low | Reassess in 2-3 years |
| 1.3-2.67 | Intermediate | Proceed to secondary assessment |
| >2.67 | High | Refer to hepatology |

#### Secondary Assessment (if intermediate FIB-4)
- Vibration-controlled transient elastography (FibroScan)
- Enhanced Liver Fibrosis (ELF) test
- Liver stiffness measurement (LSM)

### Management

#### Lifestyle Modifications (All Patients)
- **Weight loss**: 7-10% total body weight improves MASH
- **Diet**: Mediterranean diet preferred
- **Exercise**: Both aerobic and resistance training beneficial
- **Limit alcohol**: Even modest alcohol may worsen disease

#### Optimize Comorbidities
- Type 2 diabetes control (consider GLP-1 agonists, SGLT2 inhibitors)
- Lipid management (statins safe and beneficial)
- Blood pressure control
- Cardiovascular risk reduction

### Pharmacotherapy

#### FDA-Approved (as of 2024)
- **Resmetirom (Rezdiffra)**: Thyroid hormone receptor-beta agonist
  - Approved March 2024 for noncirrhotic MASH with F2-F3 fibrosis
  - First drug specifically approved for MASH

#### Off-Label Options with Evidence
- **Pioglitazone**: Consider for MASH without diabetes
- **GLP-1 receptor agonists**: Semaglutide has shown benefit
- **Vitamin E (800 IU/day)**: Consider for nondiabetic MASH

#### Not Recommended
- Ursodeoxycholic acid
- Metformin (does not improve histology)
- Omega-3 fatty acids (for MASH treatment)

### Monitoring
- Serial liver stiffness assessment
- Monitor for hepatocellular carcinoma in cirrhosis
- Cardiovascular risk assessment (leading cause of death in MASLD)

## Cirrhosis Management
- HCC surveillance: Ultrasound ± AFP every 6 months
- Variceal screening
- Liver transplant evaluation when appropriate

## Key Points
- MASLD is now the most common cause of chronic liver disease
- Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death
- Weight loss remains cornerstone of therapy
- Resmetirom is first approved pharmacotherapy
