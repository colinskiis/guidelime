## Scope
Comprehensive 2025 update to the ACG guideline for the management of ulcerative colitis (UC) in adults, featuring 54 recommendations and 57 key concepts.

## Key Recommendations

### Mild-to-Moderate UC
- **5-ASA (Mesalamine)**: Oral and/or rectal 5-aminosalicylic acid agents are the first-line therapy.
- **Rectal Therapy**: Rectal 5-ASA (suppositories or enemas) is more effective than rectal steroids for distal disease.

### Moderate-to-Severe UC
- **Anti-TNF Agents**: Infliximab, Adalimumab, and Golimumab are effective for induction and maintenance.
- **Anti-Integrin (Vedolizumab)**: Gut-selective and has a favorable safety profile; effective for both induction and maintenance.
- **Anti-IL-12/23 (Ustekinumab)**: Effective, particularly in patients who have failed anti-TNF therapy.
- **JAK Inhibitors (Tofacitinib, Upadacitinib)**: Oral agents effective for UC; monitor for VTE, herpes zoster, and cardiovascular events.
- **S1P Modulators (Ozanimod, Etrasimod)**: Newer oral therapies with efficacy for moderate-to-severe UC.

### Acute Severe UC (Hospitalized)
- **IV Corticosteroids**: Methylprednisolone is the cornerstone of initial therapy.
- **Rescue Therapy**: If no response to IV steroids by Day 3-5, infliximab or cyclosporine should be considered as rescue therapy before colectomy.

### Surgical Management
- **Colectomy**: Total proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) is the procedure of choice for patients failing medical therapy, with dysplasia, or with colon cancer.

### Monitoring
- Endoscopic mucosal healing is the target for therapy.
- Cancer surveillance colonoscopy is recommended starting 8 years after diagnosis.
