## Scope
2024 AGA clinical practice update on the diagnosis, surveillance, and management of incidentally discovered pancreatic cysts.

## Key Recommendations

### Initial Evaluation
- **MRI/MRCP**: Preferred imaging modality for characterization of pancreatic cysts.
- **CT**: Acceptable alternative.
- **EUS with Cyst Fluid Analysis**: Consider for cysts with concerning features or when cyst type is uncertain. Obtain CEA (elevated in mucinous cysts) and cytology.

### Cyst Classification
- **Serous Cystadenoma (SCA)**: Benign. Usually does not require surveillance if confidently diagnosed.
- **Mucinous Cystic Neoplasm (MCN)**: Premalignant potential; typically in women; no pancreatic duct communication.
- **Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasm (IPMN)**:
  - **Branch-duct IPMN**: Lower malignancy risk; surveillance-based management often appropriate.
  - **Main-duct IPMN**: Higher malignancy risk; surgical referral generally recommended.
- **Solid Pseudopapillary Neoplasm (SPN)**: Rare, typically young women; surgical resection recommended.

### Worrisome Features and High-Risk Stigmata (IPMN)
- **High-Risk Stigmata**: Obstructive jaundice, enhancing mural nodule ≥5 mm, main pancreatic duct ≥10 mm. → Strong indication for surgery.
- **Worrisome Features**: Cyst ≥3 cm, thickened/enhancing cyst walls, MPD 5-9 mm, abrupt change in duct caliber, lymphadenopathy. → Consider EUS, closer surveillance, or surgery.

### Surveillance Intervals
- Low-risk cysts: MRI every 12-24 months initially; may lengthen interval if stable.
- Consider discontinuing surveillance in elderly or those with limited life expectancy and stable cysts.

### Surgical Referral
- Discuss surgery for cysts with high-risk features, confirmed high-grade dysplasia, or suspected malignancy.
