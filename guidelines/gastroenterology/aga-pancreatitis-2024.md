## Scope

This guideline provides updated recommendations for the initial management of acute pancreatitis in adults.

## Key Recommendations

### Diagnosis
- Clinical presentation + elevated lipase (≥3x ULN) OR characteristic imaging
- CT not routinely needed at presentation
- Rule out biliary etiology (US, LFTs)

### Severity Assessment
- Revised Atlanta Classification: Mild, moderately severe, severe
- BISAP, APACHE II, Ranson criteria
- SIRS criteria at admission
- Persistent organ failure defines severity

### Fluid Resuscitation
**Goal-Directed Therapy:**
- Lactated Ringer's preferred over normal saline
- Moderate rate: 1.5-3 mL/kg/hr (avoid aggressive overresuscitation)
- Titrate to clinical targets (urine output, heart rate, BUN)
- Avoid excessive fluids (risk of complications)

### Nutrition
**Early Enteral Feeding:**
- Within 24-48 hours if tolerated
- Oral diet preferred in mild pancreatitis
- Nasogastric or nasojejunal if oral not tolerated
- Avoid prolonged NPO status

**Parenteral Nutrition:**
- Only if enteral not feasible for prolonged period

### Pain Management
- Multimodal analgesia
- Opioids if needed (no increased risk of sphincter of Oddi dysfunction)
- NSAIDs as adjunct if appropriate

### ERCP in Gallstone Pancreatitis
- Urgent ERCP (<24h) for cholangitis
- Early ERCP (<48-72h) for biliary obstruction without cholangitis
- Not routine for mild biliary pancreatitis without obstruction

### Cholecystectomy
- Same-admission cholecystectomy for mild biliary pancreatitis
- Delayed if necrotizing pancreatitis (6+ weeks)

### Complications
- Necrotizing pancreatitis: Conservative initially, step-up approach for infected necrosis
- Pseudocysts: Intervene if symptomatic after 4+ weeks
