## Scope
Updated "Living Guideline" from the AGA for the pharmacological management of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis (UC) in adults.

## Key Recommendations

### Induction Therapy (Biologic-Naive)
The guideline now groups therapies by efficacy:
- **High Efficacy (Tier 1)**: Recommends **Infliximab** or **Upadacitinib** as preferred first-line advanced therapies for induction of remission.
- **Intermediate Efficacy (Tier 2)**: **Vedolizumab**, **Adalimumab**, **Ustekinumab**, **Ozanimod**, and **Tofacitinib** are effective alternatives.

### Maintenance Therapy
- Patients who respond to induction with a biologic or small molecule should continue the same therapy for maintenance.

### Biologic-Exposed / Refractory UC
- **JAK Inhibitors (Upadacitinib, Tofacitinib)**: Recommended for patients who have failed anti-TNF therapy.
- **Combination Therapy**: Combination of a biologic with an immunomodulator (e.g., thiopurine) may be considered to optimize efficacy and reduce immunogenicity, particularly for infliximab.

### Corticosteroid-Sparing
- A primary goal of advanced therapy is to induce and maintain steroid-free remission.

### Safety Considerations
- **JAK Inhibitors**: Increased risk of VTE, herpes zoster, and MACE, particularly in older patients and those with cardiovascular risk factors. Use lowest effective dose for maintenance.

### Monitoring
- Clinical assessment of symptoms, periodic endoscopy with biopsies to assess mucosal healing, and laboratory monitoring (inflammatory markers, drug levels) are recommended.
