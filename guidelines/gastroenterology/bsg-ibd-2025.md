## Scope
Updated comprehensive evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis and management of adults with Ulcerative Colitis (UC) and Crohn's Disease (CD), incorporating newer advanced therapies and monitoring strategies.

## Key Recommendations

### Diagnosis and Monitoring
- **Faecal Calprotectin**: Recommended as the primary non-invasive marker for screening (to distinguish IBD from IBS) and for monitoring disease activity and response to treatment.
- **Treat-to-Target**: Endorses a "target" of clinical remission PLUS endoscopic or transmural healing.

### Management of Ulcerative Colitis (UC)
- **Topicals**: Mesalazine remains first-line for mild-to-moderate proctitis and left-sided colitis.
- **Advanced Therapy**: For moderate-to-severe UC refractory to conventional therapy, anti-TNF agents, Vedolizumab, Ustekinumab, or JAK inhibitors (e.g., Tofacitinib, Upadacitinib) are recommended.
- **JAK Inhibitors**: Specifically noted for their rapid onset of action in severe UC.

### Management of Crohn's Disease (CD)
- **Biologics**: Early introduction of biologics (top-down or accelerated step-up) is recommended for patients with poor prognostic factors (e.g., extensive disease, deep ulceration).
- **Anti-TNF**: Infliximab (typically with an immunomodulator) remains a cornerstone for fistulising disease.
- **IL-12/23 and IL-23 Inhibitors**: Ustekinumab and newer IL-23 selective agents (e.g., Risankizumab) are recommended for moderate-to-severe luminal CD.

### Iron Deficiency Anemia (IDA)
- **Screening**: All patients with IBD should be screened for IDA at diagnosis and at least annually during remission.
- **Replacement**: IV iron is preferred over oral iron for patients with active disease as it is better tolerated and more effectively improves stores.

### Health Maintenance
- **Vaccination**: Ensure patients are up-to-date with non-live vaccines prior to starting immunosuppression.
- **Bone Health**: DEXA screening for patients on long-term steroids or with other risk factors for osteoporosis.
- **Mental Health**: Routine assessment for anxiety and depression, which significantly impact IBD quality of life.
