## Scope
First ACG clinical guideline for IBS management using GRADE methodology, addressing diagnostic testing and therapeutic options for all IBS subtypes.

## Key Recommendations

### Diagnosis

#### Positive Diagnostic Criteria
- Use Rome IV criteria for diagnosis
- Diagnosis can be made based on symptoms without extensive testing in appropriate patients
- **Limited testing** recommended in patients without alarm features

#### Testing Recommendations
- **Fecal calprotectin or CRP**: Exclude IBD in non-constipated IBS
- **Celiac serology**: Recommended for IBS-D
- **Colonoscopy**: Not routine; indicated for alarm features or age ≥45-50

### Dietary Therapy

#### Low FODMAP Diet
- **Conditional recommendation** for limited trial in IBS
- Improves global symptoms
- Should be supervised by knowledgeable dietitian
- Reintroduction phase important to identify specific triggers

#### Fiber
- **Soluble fiber** (psyllium): Recommended for IBS (conditional)
- **Avoid insoluble fiber**: May worsen symptoms

### Pharmacotherapy for IBS-D

| Agent | Recommendation | Notes |
|-------|----------------|-------|
| Rifaximin | Conditional | 550mg TID x 14 days; can repeat |
| Alosetron | Conditional | Women with severe IBS-D; risk program |
| Eluxadoline | Conditional | Avoid in cholecystectomy, pancreatitis risk |
| Loperamide | Conditional | Symptomatic relief; no global symptom data |
| TCAs | Conditional | Low-dose for pain; amitriptyline, nortriptyline |
| Antispasmodics | Conditional | Dicyclomine, hyoscyamine |

### Pharmacotherapy for IBS-C

| Agent | Recommendation | Notes |
|-------|----------------|-------|
| Linaclotide | Strong | Best evidence |
| Lubiprostone | Conditional | Chloride channel activator |
| Plecanatide | Conditional | Guanylate cyclase agonist |
| Tenapanor | Conditional | NHE3 inhibitor |
| Tegaserod | Conditional | Women <65, no CV risk factors |
| **PEG**: Not recommended | Against | Insufficient evidence in IBS-C |

### Psychological Therapies
- **Gut-directed psychotherapy**: Recommended for global IBS symptoms
- CBT, hypnotherapy effective
- Consider when pharmacotherapy insufficient

### What NOT to Use
- **PEG (polyethylene glycol)**: Recommend against for IBS-C
- **Fecal microbiota transplantation**: Recommend against (insufficient evidence)
- **Probiotics**: No recommendation (inconsistent evidence)
- **Routine stool testing for pathogens**: Not recommended

### Antibiotics (Non-Rifaximin)
- **Against** use of non-rifaximin antibiotics for IBS

## IBS Subtypes
- **IBS-D**: Diarrhea-predominant
- **IBS-C**: Constipation-predominant
- **IBS-M**: Mixed bowel habits
- **IBS-U**: Unclassified

## Notes
- First guideline using GRADE methodology for IBS
- Emphasis on positive diagnosis (not diagnosis of exclusion)
- Multimodal approach often needed
