# ACG Guidelines: Management of Acute Pancreatitis

## Scope
Evidence-based recommendations for diagnosis, severity assessment, and management of acute pancreatitis (AP), including fluid resuscitation, nutrition, and management of complications.

## Key Recommendations

### Diagnosis

#### Diagnostic Criteria (2 of 3 required)
1. Abdominal pain characteristic of AP
2. Serum lipase (or amylase) ≥3x upper limit of normal
3. Characteristic findings on imaging (CT, MRI, or ultrasound)

#### Etiology Workup
- Assess for gallstones (ultrasound)
- Alcohol history
- Triglyceride level
- Medication review
- Consider MRCP/EUS if unclear etiology

### Severity Assessment

#### Classification
| Severity | Definition |
|----------|------------|
| Mild | No organ failure, no local/systemic complications |
| Moderately Severe | Transient organ failure (<48 hours) OR local complications |
| Severe | Persistent organ failure (>48 hours) |

#### Prediction of Severity
- BISAP score at admission
- APACHE II
- Serial assessment more important than initial score
- BUN, hematocrit, creatinine trending

### Fluid Resuscitation

#### Initial Approach
- **Goal-directed fluid therapy** recommended
- Lactated Ringer's preferred over normal saline (Conditional)
- **Avoid aggressive fluid resuscitation** in all patients

#### Monitoring
- Urine output
- Heart rate
- Blood pressure
- BUN trending
- Hematocrit

#### Caution
- Over-resuscitation may worsen outcomes
- Particularly harmful in severe AP

### Nutrition

#### Early Oral Feeding (Strong)
- In **mild AP**: Start oral feeding within **24-48 hours** as tolerated
- Low-fat solid diet acceptable (no need for clear liquid progression)
- Do not wait for pain resolution or enzyme normalization

#### Enteral Nutrition
- For patients who cannot eat orally
- **Enteral > Parenteral** nutrition (Strong)
- Reduces infectious complications and mortality

#### Route of Enteral Feeding
- **Nasogastric or nasojejunal** both acceptable
- No clear superiority of jejunal over gastric feeding

### Antibiotics

#### Prophylactic Antibiotics
- **NOT recommended** in predicted severe or necrotizing pancreatitis (Conditional)
- Does not prevent infected necrosis

#### Therapeutic Antibiotics
- Indicated only for documented or strongly suspected infection
- Infected necrosis: Carbapenems, fluoroquinolones, or metronidazole-based regimens
- May delay intervention beyond 4 weeks

### Management of Gallstone Pancreatitis

#### Cholangitis
- **Urgent ERCP** (<24 hours) if concurrent cholangitis

#### No Cholangitis
- ERCP not routinely indicated
- MRCP or EUS to assess for choledocholithiasis

#### Cholecystectomy
- **Same hospitalization** for mild gallstone pancreatitis
- After resolution of necrotizing pancreatitis (if occurs)

### Management of Necrosis

#### Sterile Necrosis
- Conservative management
- No drainage needed

#### Infected Necrosis
- Antibiotics first (may be sufficient in some cases)
- Delay intervention to **≥4 weeks** if possible (allows walled-off necrosis)
- **Step-up approach**: Percutaneous/endoscopic drainage → necrosectomy if needed
- Minimally invasive preferred over open surgery

### ICU Admission Criteria
- Persistent organ failure
- Need for aggressive monitoring/support
- Severe necrotizing pancreatitis
