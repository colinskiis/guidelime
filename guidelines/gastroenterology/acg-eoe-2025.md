## Scope
2025 update to the ACG guideline for the diagnosis and management of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) in children and adults.

## Key Recommendations

### Diagnosis
- **Histology**: EoE is diagnosed when ≥15 eosinophils per high-power field (eos/hpf) are identified on esophageal biopsy, in the presence of symptoms of esophageal dysfunction, and after exclusion of other causes.
- **PPI Trial No Longer Required**: PPI-responsive esophageal eosinophilia is now considered part of the EoE spectrum, and a PPI trial is no longer mandated before diagnosis.

### First-Line Therapy
- **Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs)**: Remain a highly effective and safe first-line treatment option.
- **Swallowed Topical Corticosteroids**: Budesonide or fluticasone formulated for esophageal delivery are effective first-line alternatives.
- **Elimination Diets**: 2-food or 6-food elimination diets are effective but require significant patient adherence.

### Second-Line / Biologic Therapy
- **Dupilumab**: The first FDA-approved biologic for EoE. Recommended for patients with moderate-to-severe EoE who have failed or are intolerant to conventional therapies (PPIs, steroids, diets).

### Esophageal Dilation
- Dilation is recommended for patients with symptomatic strictures or a narrow-caliber esophagus, even if inflammation is controlled. It is a safe and effective adjunct to medical therapy.

### Monitoring
- **Repeat Endoscopy with Biopsy**: Recommended 8-12 weeks after initiating or changing therapy to assess histologic response.
- **Maintenance Therapy**: Long-term maintenance therapy is recommended for most patients to prevent disease progression and fibrosis.
