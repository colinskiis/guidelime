## Scope
2024 AGA clinical practice update on the diagnosis and management of acute diverticulitis.

## Key Recommendations

### Diagnosis
- **CT Abdomen/Pelvis with Contrast**: Gold standard. Confirms diagnosis, identifies complications (abscess, perforation, fistula).
- Clinical diagnosis (LLQ pain, fever, leukocytosis) is often correct but CT is recommended for first episode or uncertain cases.

### Classification (Hinchey)
- Stage I: Pericolic abscess.
- Stage II: Pelvic/distant abscess.
- Stage III: Purulent peritonitis.
- Stage IV: Feculent peritonitis.

### Outpatient Management (Uncomplicated Diverticulitis)
- **Observation Without Antibiotics**: Appropriate for select immunocompetent patients with mild, uncomplicated diverticulitis (no abscess, no systemic signs). Close follow-up required.
- **Antibiotics**: Consider if more than minimal symptoms, systemic signs, or immunocompromised. Fluoroquinolone + metronidazole or amoxicillin-clavulanate x 7-10 days.
- Clear liquid diet initially, advance as tolerated.

### Inpatient Management
- Admit for: Severe pain, inability to tolerate oral intake, complicated diverticulitis, immunocompromise, older age with high risk.
- IV antibiotics (ceftriaxone + metronidazole or piperacillin-tazobactam).
- NPO or clear liquids initially.

### Complicated Diverticulitis
- **Abscess ≥3-4 cm**: Percutaneous drainage.
- **Perforation with Peritonitis**: Emergent surgery (Hartmann procedure or primary anastomosis ± diverting ostomy).

### Elective Surgery
- **Recurrent Diverticulitis**: No longer routine after 2 episodes; individualize based on frequency, severity, quality of life.
- **Post-Complicated Episode**: Consider elective sigmoid colectomy after recovery from complicated diverticulitis.

### Colonoscopy
- Recommend colonoscopy 6-8 weeks after resolution of acute diverticulitis (if not recently done) to exclude malignancy.
