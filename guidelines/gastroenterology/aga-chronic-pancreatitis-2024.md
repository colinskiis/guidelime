## Scope
2024 AGA clinical practice guideline on the diagnosis and management of chronic pancreatitis (CP) in adults.

## Key Recommendations

### Diagnosis
- **Clinical Presentation**: Recurrent or chronic abdominal pain, history of acute pancreatitis, exocrine/endocrine insufficiency.
- **Imaging**: CT (calcifications, ductal dilation), MRI/MRCP (ductal changes, parenchymal changes), EUS (earliest changes, Cambridge criteria).
- **Functional Testing**: Fecal elastase-1 (<200 μg/g suggests exocrine insufficiency).

### Etiology Evaluation
- Alcohol, smoking, genetic (PRSS1, SPINK1, CFTR), autoimmune, obstructive, idiopathic.
- Consider genetic testing in early-onset or idiopathic cases.

### Pain Management
- **Conservative**: Abstinence from alcohol and tobacco, low-fat diet, analgesics (NSAIDs, then opioids if needed).
- **Pancreatic Enzyme Replacement Therapy (PERT)**: May provide modest pain relief in some patients; always indicated for exocrine insufficiency.
- **Endoscopic Therapy**: ERCP with sphincterotomy, stone extraction, or pancreatic duct stenting for pain related to ductal obstruction.
- **ESWL (Extracorporeal Shock Wave Lithotripsy)**: For large pancreatic duct stones prior to or with endoscopic therapy.
- **Surgery**: For refractory pain despite optimal medical/endoscopic therapy. Options include Frey procedure, Puestow, distal pancreatectomy, or TPIAT (total pancreatectomy with islet autotransplantation) in select cases.

### Exocrine Insufficiency
- **PERT**: Pancreatic enzyme replacement with meals (40,000-50,000 lipase units per meal, adjust as needed). Take with food.
- Add PPI if response suboptimal (improves enzyme activity).

### Endocrine Insufficiency (Pancreatogenic Diabetes/Type 3c)
- Manage as diabetes; consider insulin; higher hypoglycemia risk.

### Nutritional Support
- Address fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies (A, D, E, K), osteoporosis risk.
