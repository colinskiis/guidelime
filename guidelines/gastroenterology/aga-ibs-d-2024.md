## Scope
2024 AGA guideline on the pharmacological management of irritable bowel syndrome with predominant diarrhea (IBS-D) in adults.

## Key Recommendations

### First-Line Options
- **Antidiarrheals (Loperamide)**: Conditional recommendation. May improve stool frequency and consistency but limited effect on global IBS symptoms or abdominal pain.
- **Antispasmodics**: Conditional recommendation for abdominal pain/cramping. Agents include dicyclomine, hyoscyamine, peppermint oil.

### Prescription Therapies

#### Rifaximin
- **Recommendation**: Strong recommendation for IBS-D.
- **Dosing**: 550 mg TID for 14 days. May repeat if symptoms recur.
- **Mechanism**: Non-absorbable antibiotic with anti-inflammatory effects on gut microbiome.

#### Eluxadoline
- **Recommendation**: Conditional recommendation for IBS-D.
- **Mechanism**: Mixed mu-opioid agonist/delta-opioid antagonist. Reduces diarrhea and pain.
- **Cautions**: Contraindicated in patients without a gallbladder, with biliary obstruction, pancreatitis history, or heavy alcohol use (risk of sphincter of Oddi spasm and pancreatitis).

#### Alosetron
- **Recommendation**: Conditional recommendation for women with severe IBS-D refractory to other therapies.
- **Mechanism**: 5-HT3 antagonist.
- **Cautions**: Risk of ischemic colitis and severe constipation. Requires FDA risk program.

### Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs)
- Low-dose TCAs (e.g., amitriptyline 10-25 mg at bedtime) are conditionally recommended for abdominal pain, leveraging visceral analgesic properties.

### Dietary and Non-Pharmacological Adjuncts
- Low-FODMAP diet: May help identify trigger foods.
- Probiotics: Limited evidence; strain-specific effects.
