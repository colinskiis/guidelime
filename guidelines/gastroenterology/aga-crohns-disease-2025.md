## Scope
Living clinical practice guideline providing evidence-based recommendations for the induction and maintenance of remission in adults with moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease, focusing on biologics and small molecule therapies.

## Key Recommendations

### First-line Advanced Therapies (Biologic-Naive)
- **Anti-TNF Agents**: Infliximab and adalimumab remain strong first-line options for induction and maintenance of remission.
- **IL-23 Inhibitors**: Risankizumab and guselkumab (new for 2024/25) are recommended as effective first-line options, particularly for those with high risk of infection or specific comorbidities.
- **Anti-Integrin**: Vedolizumab is recommended, especially for patients where systemic immunosuppression is a concern, though potentially slower acting than anti-TNF or IL-23 agents.

### Biologic-Experienced Patients
- **Switching Class**: If a patient fails an anti-TNF agent, risankizumab or upadacitinib are suggested over switching to a second anti-TNF.
- **Upadacitinib (JAK Inhibitor)**: Strong recommendation for induction and maintenance in patients who have failed prior biologics (TNF, IL-23, or integrin inhibitors).

### Combination Therapy
- **Infliximab + Immunomodulator**: Recommended over infliximab monotherapy to improve drug levels and half-life, especially in patients with high inflammatory burden.
- **Adalimumab**: Monotherapy may be used, but combination with an immunomodulator (azathioprine or methotrexate) may still be considered.

### Treatment Goals
- **Objective Remission**: Management should aim for both clinical remission (symptoms) and endoscopic remission (mucosal healing).
- **Monitoring**: Close monitoring (e.g., fecal calprotectin, C-reactive protein, and periodic endoscopy) is required to ensure treatment success.

### De-escalation
- Recommends **against** withdrawing biologics in patients who are in clinical and endoscopic remission unless there are significant safety concerns or patient preference, as the risk of relapse is high.

### Safety and Monitoring
- **Screening**: Baseline screening for TB, Hepatitis B, and C is required for all advanced therapies.
- **JAK Inhibitor Cautions**: Specific monitoring for VTE risk, shingles (ensure vaccination), and lipid profiles when using upadacitinib.
- **IL-23 Inhibitors**: Generally favorable safety profile with lower risk of serious infections compared to other classes.
