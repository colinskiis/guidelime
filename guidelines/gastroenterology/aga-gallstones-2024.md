## Scope
2024 AGA clinical practice guideline on the management of gallstone disease, including symptomatic gallstones, acute cholecystitis, and common bile duct (CBD) stones.

## Key Recommendations

### Asymptomatic Gallstones
- **Observation**: Routine cholecystectomy is NOT recommended for asymptomatic gallstones.
- Exceptions: Porcelain gallbladder (calcified wall – malignancy risk), very large gallstones (>3 cm, higher cancer risk), concomitant surgery, or certain immunocompromised states.

### Biliary Colic (Symptomatic Gallstones Without Complications)
- **Cholecystectomy**: Elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy is recommended to prevent recurrent symptoms and complications.

### Acute Cholecystitis
- **Early Cholecystectomy**: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy within 72 hours of presentation is preferred (faster recovery, lower overall morbidity).
- **Antibiotics**: Administer for treatment; coverage for gram-negatives and anaerobes.
- **High-Risk Surgical Patients**: Percutaneous cholecystostomy as a bridge or alternative.

### CBD Stones (Choledocholithiasis)
- **Diagnosis**: MRCP or EUS for suspected CBD stones if clinical probability is intermediate.
- **ERCP**: Therapeutic ERCP for confirmed CBD stones (stone extraction, sphincterotomy).
- **Single-Stage vs. Two-Stage Approach**:
  - Laparoscopic cholecystectomy + intraoperative cholangiography ± CBD exploration (single-stage) OR
  - Pre-operative ERCP followed by cholecystectomy (two-stage) – both are acceptable.

### Acute Cholangitis
- Urgent ERCP for biliary decompression.
- IV antibiotics.

### Pregnancy
- Cholecystectomy can be safely performed in the second trimester if indicated.
- ERCP with radiation minimization techniques is possible.

### Gallstone Pancreatitis
- Cholecystectomy during the same hospitalization is recommended (once pancreatitis resolves) to prevent recurrence.
