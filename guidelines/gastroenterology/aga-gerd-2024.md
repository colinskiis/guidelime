## Scope
2024 AGA clinical practice update on the diagnosis and management of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in adults.

## Key Recommendations

### Diagnosis
- **Clinical Diagnosis**: Typical symptoms (heartburn, regurgitation) 2+/week with response to PPI trial is sufficient for uncomplicated GERD.
- **Alarm Symptoms**: Dysphagia, odynophagia, weight loss, GI bleeding, anemia → EGD to rule out complications or malignancy.

### When to Test Objectively
- PPI-refractory symptoms.
- Prior to anti-reflux surgery.
- Atypical symptoms (cough, laryngeal).
- **Testing Options**:
  - EGD to evaluate erosive esophagitis, Barrett's, stricture.
  - Ambulatory pH monitoring (wireless Bravo or catheter-based) or pH-impedance to quantify reflux burden.

### Medical Treatment

#### Lifestyle Modifications
- Weight loss (if overweight), elevate head of bed, avoid late meals, avoid trigger foods (individualize).

#### Pharmacotherapy
- **PPI (Once-Daily)**: First-line. Taken 30-60 min before breakfast.
- **Step-Down Therapy**: After 8 weeks, attempt to reduce to lowest effective PPI dose or H2RA.
- **H2 Receptor Antagonists**: Adjunct for nocturnal symptoms or intermittent use.
- **PPI Safety**: Long-term PPIs are generally safe; concerns about fractures, kidney disease, infections are mostly from observational data with low absolute risk.

### PPI-Refractory GERD
- Optimize PPI (timing, adherence, switch PPI).
- Objective testing (pH monitoring) to confirm true refractory reflux vs. functional heartburn.
- Consider augmenting with H2RA, baclofen (for belching/regurgitation), or prokinetics.

### Surgical and Endoscopic Therapies
- **Laparoscopic Fundoplication (Nissen, Toupet)**: Effective for PPI-responsive GERD and patients preferring surgery.
- **Magnetic Sphincter Augmentation (LINX)**: Alternative for eligible patients.
- **Transoral Incisionless Fundoplication (TIF)**: Endoscopic option.
