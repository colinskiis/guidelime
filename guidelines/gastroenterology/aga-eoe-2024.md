## Scope
2024 AGA clinical practice update on the diagnosis and management of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) in adults and children.

## Key Recommendations

### Diagnosis
- **Symptoms**: Dysphagia, food impaction, heartburn, chest pain in adults; feeding difficulties, vomiting, failure to thrive in children.
- **Endoscopy**: Rings, furrows, exudates, edema, stricture (EREFS scoring).
- **Histology**: ≥15 eosinophils per high-power field (eos/HPF) on esophageal biopsy (proximal and distal) in absence of other causes of eosinophilia.

### Treatment Goals
- Symptom improvement and histologic remission (<15 eos/HPF, preferably <6).

### First-Line Therapy

#### Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPI)
- High-dose PPI (omeprazole 40 mg BID or equivalent) is an effective first-line therapy for ~50% of patients.
- PPI-responsive EoE is part of the EoE spectrum.

#### Topical Corticosteroids
- **Swallowed Budesonide** (oral viscous budesonide, effervescent tablet, or orodispersible) or **Fluticasone** (swallowed from MDI).
- Highly effective for histologic and symptom response.
- Available branded products (APT-1011, Eohilia) or compounded/off-label use.

### Second-Line / Refractory EoE

#### Dupilumab (Dupixent)
- FDA-approved for EoE in patients ≥12 years (and recently ≥1 year).
- IL-4/IL-13 inhibitor. Highly effective for steroid-refractory or maintenance.

#### Dietary Elimination
- Empiric elimination diets (6-food, 4-food, 2-food, or 1-food [dairy]) may be offered, especially for motivated patients.
- Sequential reintroduction to identify triggers.

### Esophageal Dilation
- For patients with symptomatic stricture. Safe and effective for dysphagia; does not treat underlying inflammation.

### Maintenance Therapy
- Many patients require ongoing therapy (PPI, topical steroids, or dupilumab) to maintain remission. EoE is a chronic disease.
