# AGA Clinical Practice Guideline on the Role of Biomarkers for the Management of Crohn's Disease

## Scope
Evidence-based recommendations on the use of fecal calprotectin and serum CRP in monitoring and managing Crohn's disease.

## Key Recommendations

### Biomarker Use in Clinical Practice

#### Symptomatic Crohn's Disease

##### Fecal Calprotectin
- **Recommend** using fecal calprotectin to inform disease management
- Elevated calprotectin suggests active inflammation
- Can help differentiate active CD from IBS-like symptoms

##### Serum CRP
- **Recommend** using CRP to inform disease management
- Elevated CRP correlates with active inflammation
- Less specific than calprotectin for intestinal inflammation

#### Asymptomatic Crohn's Disease

##### Monitoring Role
- **Recommend** using fecal calprotectin for monitoring
- **Recommend** using serum CRP for monitoring
- Elevated biomarkers despite symptom control suggest subclinical inflammation

### Clinical Decision-Making

#### Concordant Results
- Symptoms + elevated biomarkers → Active disease likely
- No symptoms + normal biomarkers → Remission likely

#### Discordant Results
| Scenario | Recommendation |
|----------|----------------|
| Symptoms + normal biomarkers | Consider IBS, functional symptoms, or stenotic disease |
| No symptoms + elevated biomarkers | Endoscopic evaluation to confirm subclinical inflammation |

### Biomarker Thresholds

#### Fecal Calprotectin
- Normal: <50-100 μg/g (varies by assay)
- Active inflammation: >200-250 μg/g typically significant
- Threshold depends on clinical context and assay used

#### C-Reactive Protein
- Normal: <5-10 mg/L
- Elevated: Varies by patient; serial trends important
- Some CD patients are "CRP non-responders"

### When to Consider Endoscopy
- Biomarker-symptom discordance
- Treatment decisions (escalation, de-escalation)
- Surveillance for dysplasia
- Assess mucosal healing

### Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM)
- Separate from biomarkers but complementary
- Consider TDM for treatment optimization
- Combine with biomarkers for comprehensive assessment

### Monitoring Intervals
- No specific interval strongly recommended
- Suggested: Every 3-6 months in active disease
- Every 6-12 months in stable remission
- More frequently during treatment changes

### Limitations
- Biomarkers may not reflect isolated ileal disease well
- Stricturing disease may have lower calprotectin
- Enteric infections can elevate calprotectin
- CRP can be elevated by non-GI inflammation

## Key Messages
- Biomarkers are valuable adjuncts to clinical assessment
- Do not replace endoscopy for definitive disease evaluation
- Serial trends more informative than single values
- Discordance between symptoms and biomarkers merits investigation
