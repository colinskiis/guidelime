## Scope
2024 AGA clinical practice update on the diagnosis, surveillance, and management of Barrett's esophagus (BE).

## Key Recommendations

### Screening
- Consider screening EGD for patients with chronic GERD and multiple risk factors for BE/esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC): male sex, white race, age >50, obesity, smoking, family history of BE/EAC.
- Screening may be done via standard EGD or non-endoscopic devices (e.g., Cytosponge where available).

### Diagnosis
- **Histologic Confirmation**: BE is defined by intestinal metaplasia (goblet cells) on biopsy of salmon-colored mucosa extending ≥1 cm above the GEJ.
- Seattle protocol biopsies: 4-quadrant biopsies every 1-2 cm.

### Surveillance (Non-Dysplastic BE)
- **Short Segment BE (<3 cm)**: EGD every 3-5 years.
- **Long Segment BE (≥3 cm)**: EGD every 2-3 years.
- Continue PPI therapy.

### Low-Grade Dysplasia (LGD)
- Confirm diagnosis with expert GI pathologist.
- Options: Repeat EGD in 6 months, or endoscopic eradication therapy (EET) (RFA, cryotherapy) if persistent confirmed LGD.

### High-Grade Dysplasia (HGD) / Intramucosal Carcinoma
- **Endoscopic Eradication Therapy (EET)**: Preferred approach.
  - Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) or ESD for visible lesions.
  - Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) or cryotherapy for flat dysplasia and residual BE.
- Esophagectomy is reserved for failed EET, submucosal invasion, or poorly differentiated tumors.

### Post-EET Surveillance
- EGD with biopsies at 3, 6, 12 months after EET, then annually for at least 2 years, then consider every 1-2 years long-term.
- Recurrence (intestinal metaplasia or dysplasia) occurs in ~10% annually; ongoing surveillance is essential.

### PPI Therapy
- All patients with BE should be on once-daily PPI for acid suppression.
