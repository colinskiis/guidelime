# EASL Clinical Practice Guidelines on Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure

## Scope
Evidence-based recommendations for the management of acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF), a severe form of acutely decompensated cirrhosis with organ failure(s) and high short-term mortality.

## Key Definitions

### ACLF Definition
- Severe form of acutely decompensated cirrhosis
- Characterized by organ system failure(s)
- High risk of short-term mortality (28-day mortality 20-80% depending on grade)

### ACLF Grades
- **Grade 1**: Single organ failure (kidney) OR single non-kidney organ failure with renal dysfunction
- **Grade 2**: Two organ failures
- **Grade 3**: Three or more organ failures

### Precipitants
- **Identified**: Proven bacterial infection/sepsis, severe alcohol-related hepatitis, drug-induced liver injury, viral hepatitis reactivation
- **Unidentified**: Many cases have no clinically apparent trigger

## Key Recommendations

### Diagnosis and Assessment
- Use CLIF-C ACLF score for prognostication
- Assess for organ failures: liver, kidney, brain, coagulation, circulation, respiration
- Identify and treat precipitating factors

### ICU Management
- Early ICU admission for ACLF grade 2-3
- Organ support as appropriate (vasopressors, RRT, mechanical ventilation)
- Reassess prognosis at days 3-7

### Infection Management
- High index of suspicion for infection
- Empiric antibiotics based on local resistance patterns
- De-escalate based on culture results

### Kidney Failure
- Rule out other causes of AKI
- Terlipressin + albumin for HRS-ACLF
- Early RRT if indicated

### Hepatic Encephalopathy
- Lactulose and rifaximin
- Identify and treat precipitants
- Consider intubation for airway protection if severe

### Circulatory Failure
- Norepinephrine first-line vasopressor
- Target MAP ≥65 mmHg
- Consider hydrocortisone for refractory shock

### Futility and Goals of Care
- Reassess at 3-7 days
- ACLF grade 3 with ≥4 organ failures at day 3-7 has extremely poor prognosis without transplant
- Early palliative care involvement when appropriate

### Liver Transplantation
- Early transplant evaluation for all ACLF patients
- ACLF not an absolute contraindication
- Consider high-urgency listing for rapidly deteriorating patients
- Discuss with transplant center early

## Key Messages
- ACLF is distinct from acute decompensation
- Early recognition and ICU care improve outcomes
- Transplantation can be life-saving even in advanced ACLF
- Futility assessment important to avoid prolonged suffering
