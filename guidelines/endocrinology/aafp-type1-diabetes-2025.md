## Scope
Framework designed to help family physicians manage individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D) across the lifespan, emphasizing the role of the primary care physician in coordinated, multidisciplinary care.

## Key Framework Elements

### Diagnosis and Classification
- **Differential Diagnosis**: Ensure correct classification of T1D vs T2D, especially in adults (LADA).
- **Biomarkers**: Use of autoantibody testing (e.g., GAD65, IA-2, ZnT8) and C-peptide levels where classification is uncertain.

### Insulin Management
- **Multiple Daily Injections (MDI)**: Standard of care using basal and bolus (rapid-acting) insulin.
- **Continuous Insulin Infusion (CSII)**: Integration of insulin pumps.
- **Personalization**: Dosing must be tailored to the individual's activity, carbohydrate intake, and glycemic patterns.

### Technology Integration
- **Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM)**: Recommended for all individuals with T1D to improve glycemic control and reduce hypoglycemia risk.
- **Automated Insulin Delivery (AID)**: Guidance on the primary care role in supporting patients using "closed-loop" systems.

### Acute Complication Prevention
- **Hypoglycemia**: Education on recognition, treatment (glucagon), and prevention.
- **Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA)**: Sick-day management protocols and education on ketone monitoring.

### Multidisciplinary Team
- **Coordination**: The family physician should coordinate care with:
  - Endocrinology
  - Certified Diabetes Care and Education Specialists (CDCES)
  - Nutritionists/Registered Dietitians
  - Behavioral health specialists (addressing "diabetes distress")

### Screenings for Comorbidities
- **Autoimmune Screening**: Periodic screening for celiac disease and autoimmune thyroid disease.
- **Microvascular Screening**: Annual eye exams, nephropathy screening (uACR), and foot exams.
- **Cardiovascular Risk**: Management of hypertension and dyslipidemia.
