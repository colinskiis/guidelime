## Scope
Comprehensive update of the Endocrine Society guideline for the evaluation and management of Primary Aldosteronism (PA), reflecting new diagnostic pathways and expanded screening recommendations.

## Key Recommendations

### Expanded Screening
- **Indications**: Screen for PA in patients with:
  - Sustained blood pressure >150/100 mmHg.
  - Resistant hypertension (on 3+ agents).
  - Hypertension and spontaneous or diuretic-induced hypokalemia.
  - Hypertension and adrenal incidentaloma.
  - Hypertension and a family history of early-onset HTN or stroke (<40y).
  - All first-degree relatives of patients with PA.

### Diagnosis (The Screening Step)
- **ARR (Aldosterone-to-Renin Ratio)**: Use the ARR as the primary screening test.
- **Conditions**: Renin should be measured as Plasma Renin Activity (PRA) or Direct Renin Concentration (DRC). ARR is most sensitive when performed while the patient is upright.
- **Interferences**: Clinicians should recognize that mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) and some other BP meds can cause false negatives; if ARR is inconclusive, consider repeating after adjusting medications.

### Confirmatory Testing
- **Procedure**: If ARR is positive, perform confirmatory testing (e.g., oral salt loading or saline infusion test) unless the patient has spontaneous hypokalemia, very low renin, and plasma aldosterone >20 ng/dL.

### Subtype Classification
- **Adrenal CT**: Recommended as the initial imaging step in all patients with confirmed PA to exclude large masses and assist in planning further studies.
- **Adrenal Vein Sampling (AVS)**: The "gold standard" to differentiate unilateral from bilateral disease in patients seeking surgical cure. AVS should be performed by an experienced interventional radiologist.

### Management
- **Unilateral Disease (e.g., Adenoma)**: Laparoscopic adrenalectomy is the preferred treatment for patients with confirmed unilateral PA.
- **Bilateral Disease (e.g., Hyperplasia)**: Medical management with Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonists (MRAs) is the treatment of choice.
  - **Spironolactone**: Effective but may cause dose-dependent side effects (gynecomastia, impotence).
  - **Eplerenone**: Preferred if side effects from spironolactone occur; may require twice-daily dosing.

### Targeted Outcomes
- Goal is to normalize blood pressure, potassium levels, and suppress aldosterone to prevent long-term cardiovascular and renal damage.
