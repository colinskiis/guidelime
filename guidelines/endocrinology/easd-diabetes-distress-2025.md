## Scope
First-ever EASD clinical practice guideline focused on the assessment and management of diabetes distress (DD) in adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.

## Key Recommendations

### Definition
- **Diabetes Distress (DD)**: The emotional burden and worries that stem from living with and managing diabetes. It is distinct from clinical depression or anxiety, though they can co-occur.
- **Common Manifestations**: Feeling overwhelmed by diabetes management, frustration with glucose variability, fear of complications, and burnout.

### Screening
- **Routine Screening**: All adults with diabetes should be routinely screened for diabetes distress using a validated tool, such as the Problem Areas in Diabetes (PAID) scale or the Diabetes Distress Scale (DDS).
- **Frequency**: At diagnosis, during significant changes in treatment, and periodically thereafter (e.g., annually).

### Management Strategies
- **Person-Centered Care**: Tailor management strategies to the individual's specific sources of distress.
- **Simplify Regimens**: Reducing complexity of treatment regimens (e.g., simplifying insulin dosing, using technology like CGM) can alleviate distress.
- **Address Fear of Hypoglycemia**: Provide education and use of technology to reduce hypoglycemia and the fear associated with it.
- **Diabetes-Focused Psychological Support**: Referral to a diabetes psychologist or mental health professional with expertise in chronic illness is recommended for moderate-to-severe distress.

### Team-Based Approach
- Diabetes distress should be addressed by the multidisciplinary care team, including endocrinologists, diabetes educators, dietitians, and mental health professionals.

### Distinguishing from Depression
- If screening suggests clinical depression or anxiety, validated instruments (e.g., PHQ-9, GAD-7) should be used and appropriate treatment, including therapy or pharmacotherapy, considered.
