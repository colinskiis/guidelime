## Scope
2024 Endocrine Society guideline update on the diagnosis and management of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in adolescents and adults.

## Key Recommendations

### Diagnosis (Rotterdam Criteria)
- Requires ≥2 of 3:
  1. Oligo-ovulation or anovulation.
  2. Clinical and/or biochemical hyperandrogenism.
  3. Polycystic ovarian morphology on ultrasound (≥20 follicles per ovary or increased ovarian volume).
- Exclude other causes: thyroid disease, hyperprolactinemia, non-classical CAH, Cushing syndrome.

### Adolescents
- Diagnosis should be made cautiously; irregular menses and acne are common in early adolescence.
- Both hyperandrogenism AND oligo-/anovulation required; polycystic ovaries on US are less reliable in adolescents.

### Lifestyle Intervention (All Patients)
- Weight management, exercise, healthy diet.
- First-line for metabolic and reproductive outcomes.

### Menstrual Irregularity / Endometrial Protection
- **Combined Oral Contraceptives (COCs)**: First-line for menstrual regulation and hyperandrogenism symptoms. Provides endometrial protection.
- **Cyclic Progestin**: Alternative if COCs contraindicated.

### Hirsutism
- **COCs**: First-line; may take 6+ months for visible effect.
- **Add Anti-Androgen** (Spironolactone): If inadequate response to COCs after 6 months.
- Mechanical hair removal (laser, electrolysis) as adjunct.

### Infertility
- **Letrozole**: First-line ovulation induction agent for anovulatory PCOS.
- **Clomiphene Citrate**: Alternative.
- **Gonadotropins, IVF**: For clomiphene/letrozole-resistant or other indications.
- **Metformin**: Adjunct to ovulation induction; may improve ovulation rates but less effective than letrozole alone.

### Metabolic Screening
- Screen for prediabetes/diabetes (OGTT preferred), dyslipidemia, metabolic syndrome.
- Metformin may be considered for metabolic benefits, particularly in patients with impaired glucose tolerance.
