## Scope
2025 update to the AACE visual algorithm for the evaluation and treatment of adults with obesity and adiposity-based chronic disease (ABCD).

## Key Recommendations

### Staging (Edmonds Staging System for ABCD)
- **Stage 0**: No complications.
- **Stage 1**: Mild complications (e.g., prediabetes, mild hypertension).
- **Stage 2**: Moderate complications (e.g., T2DM, OSA, significant joint disease).
- **Stage 3**: Severe complications (end-organ damage, e.g., HF, CKD stage 4-5, significant mobility impairment).

### Treatment Goals
- Focus on health outcomes, not just weight loss on a scale.
- Target weight loss of ≥10-15% for improved comorbidity control with pharmacotherapy; ≥20-30% with surgery.

### Lifestyle Intervention
- Foundation of therapy for all stages.
- Reduced-calorie diet, increased physical activity, behavioral support.

### Pharmacotherapy
- **Indicated for**: BMI ≥27 kg/m² with at least one obesity-related complication, or BMI ≥30 kg/m².
- **GLP-1 Receptor Agonists (Semaglutide 2.4mg)**: First-line pharmacotherapy for most patients given excellent efficacy and safety profile.
- **Tirzepatide (GLP-1/GIP dual agonist)**: Superior weight loss efficacy; considered a preferred agent.
- **Other Agents**: Phentermine-topiramate, naltrexone-bupropion, orlistat. Selection based on patient profile and contraindications.

### Metabolic/Bariatric Surgery
- **Indicated for**: BMI ≥40 kg/m², or BMI ≥35 kg/m² with significant obesity-related complications, or BMI ≥30 kg/m² with T2DM inadequately controlled on optimal medical therapy.
- Procedures: Sleeve gastrectomy, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, One-anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB), etc.

### Long-Term Follow-Up
- Obesity is a chronic disease requiring lifelong management. Reframe focus from "diet" to sustained lifestyle modification and medical management.
