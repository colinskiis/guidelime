# AACE Consensus Statement: Algorithm for Evaluation and Treatment of Obesity/ABCD

## Scope
Evidence-based algorithmic guidance for person-centered evaluation and treatment of adults with obesity/adiposity-based chronic disease (ABCD).

## Key Recommendations

### Guiding Principles

#### Disease Recognition
| Concept | Details |
|---------|---------|
| ABCD | Adiposity-Based Chronic Disease |
| Chronic disease | Requires long-term treatment |
| Beyond BMI | Complication-centric approach |
| Health optimization | Not just weight reduction |

#### Person-Centered Care
| Principle | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Weight bias | Address and reduce stigma |
| Shared decision-making | Central to treatment |
| Individual goals | Patient-defined objectives |
| Biopsychosocial model | Comprehensive approach |

### Diagnosis and Evaluation

#### Initial Assessment
| Component | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| BMI | Calculate and document |
| Body composition | Consider if available |
| Waist circumference | Abdominal adiposity |
| Medical history | Obesity-related complications |
| Medication review | Weight-affecting medications |

#### Obesity-Related Chronic Diseases (ORCD)
| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Cardiovascular | Hypertension, dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis |
| Metabolic | Type 2 diabetes, prediabetes, MASLD |
| Mechanical | Osteoarthritis, sleep apnea |
| Reproductive | PCOS, infertility |
| Psychological | Depression, eating disorders |
| Cancer | Obesity-related malignancies |

#### Staging
| Stage | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Stage 0 | No complications |
| Stage 1 | 1-2 mild/moderate complications |
| Stage 2 | ≥1 severe complication |

### Behavioral/Lifestyle Therapy

#### Nutrition
| Recommendation | Details |
|----------------|---------|
| Caloric deficit | Individualized reduction |
| Diet pattern | Evidence-based approaches |
| Mediterranean | Strong evidence |
| Low carbohydrate | Effective option |
| Protein | Adequate intake (1-1.5 g/kg) |

#### Physical Activity
| Component | Recommendation |
|-----------|----------------|
| Aerobic | 150-300 min/week moderate intensity |
| Resistance | 2-3 sessions/week |
| Reduction in sedentary time | Throughout day |
| Individualization | Based on abilities and preferences |

#### Behavioral Interventions
| Technique | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Self-monitoring | Food diaries, weight tracking |
| Goal setting | SMART goals |
| Stimulus control | Modify environment |
| Stress management | Address emotional eating |
| Cognitive restructuring | Address thought patterns |

#### Sleep
- Optimize sleep duration (7-9 hours)
- Address sleep disorders
- Sleep apnea screening and treatment

### Pharmacotherapy

#### When to Consider
| Indication | Details |
|------------|---------|
| BMI ≥30 | With lifestyle modification |
| BMI ≥27 | With obesity-related complication |
| Failed lifestyle | Insufficient response to diet/exercise |

#### Medication Selection
| Approach | Details |
|----------|---------|
| Complication-centric | Target specific ORCDs |
| Efficacy | Consider expected weight loss |
| Side effects | Patient-specific tolerability |
| Cost | Insurance coverage, affordability |
| Patient preference | Injection vs oral |

#### Medication Hierarchy
| Priority | Agents |
|----------|--------|
| High efficacy | GLP-1 agonists (semaglutide, tirzepatide) |
| Moderate efficacy | Phentermine-topiramate, naltrexone-bupropion |
| Older agents | Phentermine (short-term), orlistat |

#### GLP-1 Receptor Agonists
| Medication | Efficacy |
|------------|----------|
| Tirzepatide | ~20% weight loss |
| Semaglutide 2.4 mg | ~15% weight loss |
| Liraglutide 3.0 mg | ~8% weight loss |

#### Considerations by Comorbidity
| Comorbidity | Preferred Agents |
|-------------|------------------|
| Type 2 diabetes | GLP-1 agonists, tirzepatide |
| Cardiovascular disease | Semaglutide (proven CV benefit) |
| Depression/anxiety | Avoid bupropion if contraindicated |
| Seizure history | Avoid topiramate |
| Substance abuse | Avoid controlled substances |

### Metabolic Surgery

#### Indications
| BMI | Criteria |
|-----|----------|
| ≥40 | With or without complications |
| ≥35 | With at least one obesity-related comorbidity |
| 30-34.9 | Consider if diabetes with inadequate control |

#### Procedures
| Procedure | Expected Weight Loss |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Sleeve gastrectomy | 25-30% |
| Roux-en-Y gastric bypass | 30-35% |
| Duodenal switch | 35-40% |

#### Preoperative Requirements
- Comprehensive evaluation
- Nutritional assessment
- Psychological evaluation
- Medical optimization

#### Postoperative Care
- Lifelong vitamin/mineral supplementation
- Regular monitoring
- Support groups
- Long-term follow-up

### Lower-Cost Treatment Options

#### Step Therapy
| Step | Approach |
|------|----------|
| 1 | Lifestyle + lower-cost medications |
| 2 | Add or switch to newer agents if needed |
| 3 | Consider surgery if medication failure |

#### Cost Considerations
- Generic options when available
- Manufacturer programs
- Insurance navigation
- Value-based care

### Long-Term Management

#### Maintenance
| Strategy | Details |
|----------|---------|
| Ongoing medication | Often required long-term |
| Continued lifestyle | Diet, exercise, behavior |
| Regular monitoring | Weight, complications |
| Adjust treatment | As needed |

#### Weight Regain Prevention
- Recognize as common
- Address promptly
- Intensify treatment as needed
- Consider medication or surgery

### Equity and Access

#### Reducing Disparities
- Address weight bias
- Culturally appropriate care
- Remove barriers to treatment
- Advocate for coverage
