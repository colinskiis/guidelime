## Scope

This guideline provides updated recommendations for the pharmacological treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis and fracture prevention.

## Key Recommendations

### Treatment Indications
- Osteoporosis (T-score ≤-2.5)
- Low bone mass (T-score -1 to -2.5) + high fracture probability (FRAX)
- Prior fragility fracture
- Long-term glucocorticoid therapy

### First-Line Therapies
**Oral Bisphosphonates:**
- Alendronate 70mg weekly
- Risedronate 35mg weekly or 150mg monthly
- Effective, well-established, cost-effective

**IV Bisphosphonates:**
- Zoledronic acid 5mg annually
- For GI intolerance or adherence issues

**Denosumab:**
- 60mg SC every 6 months
- Superior to bisphosphonates for hip fractures
- Rebound bone loss if discontinued; requires transition plan

### High/Very High Fracture Risk
**Anabolic Agents (First-Line for Very High Risk):**
- Romosozumab 210mg SC monthly x 12 months (then antiresorptive)
- Teriparatide or abaloparatide 1-2 years (then antiresorptive)

**Indications for Anabolic Therapy:**
- Very low T-score (<-3.0)
- Recent fracture
- Multiple fractures
- Fracture on bisphosphonates

### Treatment Duration
- Bisphosphonates: Drug holiday after 5 years (oral) or 3 years (IV) if moderate risk
- Continue in high-risk patients
- Reassess fracture risk periodically

### Monitoring
- DXA every 1-2 years during treatment
- Bone turnover markers for adherence and response
- Clinical response (fracture occurrence)

### Transitioning Therapy
- Discontinuing denosumab requires bisphosphonate transition
- After anabolic therapy, transition to antiresorptive to maintain gains

### Calcium and Vitamin D
- Adequate calcium (1000-1200mg/day) and vitamin D (800-1000 IU/day)
- Supplementation if dietary intake insufficient
