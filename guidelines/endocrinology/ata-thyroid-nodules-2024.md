## Scope
2024 American Thyroid Association update on the evaluation and management of thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC).

## Key Recommendations

### Thyroid Nodule Evaluation
- **Ultrasound**: All patients with known or suspected thyroid nodules should have a dedicated thyroid ultrasound.
- **TSH**: Measure serum TSH. If low, consider thyroid scintigraphy to identify hyperfunctioning ("hot") nodules, which rarely require FNA.

### Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA)
- Recommend FNA based on ultrasound pattern (ATA risk stratification: high, intermediate, low, very low suspicion) and nodule size.
- Generally, FNA for nodules ≥1 cm with intermediate-high suspicion patterns.

### Bethesda Classification and Molecular Testing
- Bethesda III/IV (atypia/follicular neoplasm): Consider molecular testing (e.g., ThyroSeq, Afirma GSC) to refine malignancy risk and guide surgery vs. surveillance.

### Differentiated Thyroid Cancer (Papillary/Follicular)

#### Surgery
- **Lobectomy**: May be sufficient for low-risk, unifocal, intrathyroidal tumors <4 cm without extrathyroidal extension.
- **Total Thyroidectomy**: For larger tumors, bilateral disease, extrathyroidal extension, or when RAI is planned.

#### Radioactive Iodine (RAI) Therapy
- Not routinely recommended for low-risk DTC.
- Consider for intermediate-risk or high-risk features (extensive lymph node involvement, extrathyroidal extension, aggressive histology).

#### TSH Suppression
- Low-risk: Target TSH 0.5-2.0 mIU/L.
- High-risk: Target TSH <0.1 mIU/L initially; relax if disease-free over time.

### Active Surveillance (Select Low-Risk Papillary Microcarcinoma)
- May be offered as an alternative to immediate surgery for very low-risk, small (<1 cm) papillary thyroid cancers with appropriate patient selection and follow-up.
