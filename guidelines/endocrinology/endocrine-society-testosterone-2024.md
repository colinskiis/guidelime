## Scope
2024 update to the Endocrine Society guideline on testosterone therapy in adult men with hypogonadism.

## Key Recommendations

### Diagnosis
- Diagnose hypogonadism based on symptoms AND consistently low morning total testosterone (measured on at least 2 occasions).
- **Cutoff**: Total testosterone <300 ng/dL is commonly used, though clinical context matters.
- Confirm with repeat testing; consider free testosterone if SHBG abnormalities suspected.

### Indications for Testosterone Therapy
- Men with symptomatic hypogonadism (sexual dysfunction, fatigue, reduced muscle mass, low bone density, mood changes) AND confirmed low testosterone.
- Benefits include improved sexual function, energy, bone density, and body composition.

### Contraindications
- Prostate cancer (active or history, high risk).
- Breast cancer.
- Erythrocytosis (hematocrit >54%).
- Untreated severe OSA.
- Severe heart failure (NYHA IV).
- Desire for fertility (testosterone suppresses spermatogenesis).

### Formulations
- Injectable (cypionate, enanthate), transdermal gels/patches, intranasal, subcutaneous pellets.
- Choose based on patient preference, cost, and monitoring considerations.

### Monitoring
- Check testosterone levels 3-6 months after initiation and adjust dose.
- Monitor hematocrit (risk of polycythemia), PSA, lipid panel, and symptoms.

### Cardiovascular Safety
- The TRAVERSE trial showed no increased risk of MACE in men 45-80 years with CV disease or high CV risk. Testosterone therapy considered reasonably safe from a CV perspective in appropriately selected patients.

### Fertility
- Testosterone therapy suppresses spermatogenesis. Offer alternative treatments (e.g., clomiphene, hCG) for men desiring fertility.
