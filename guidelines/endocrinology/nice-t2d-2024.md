## Scope
2024 update to NICE guideline NG28 on the diagnosis and management of type 2 diabetes in adults.

## Key Recommendations

### Diagnosis
- Diagnose diabetes based on HbA1c ≥48 mmol/mol (6.5%) OR fasting plasma glucose ≥7.0 mmol/L OR 2-hour glucose ≥11.1 mmol/L on OGTT. Symptoms + random glucose ≥11.1 mmol/L also confirms diagnosis.

### Glycemic Targets
- **HbA1c Target**: Generally 48-53 mmol/mol (6.5-7.0%). Individualize based on patient factors (age, comorbidities, hypoglycemia risk).
- For older adults or those at high hypoglycemia risk, relaxed targets are appropriate.

### First-Line Therapy
- **Metformin**: Remains first-line for all patients. Standard-release or modified-release based on GI tolerance.

### Second-Line and Add-On Therapies
- **SGLT2 Inhibitors (e.g., dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, canagliflozin)**: Strongly recommended for patients with established CVD, heart failure, or CKD due to cardiorenal benefits.
- **GLP-1 Receptor Agonists (e.g., semaglutide, dulaglutide, liraglutide)**: Recommended for patients with high CV risk, obesity, or when further glycemic control is needed.
- SGLT2i and GLP-1 RA can be added early in the treatment pathway, especially for cardiorenal protection.

### Sulfonylureas, DPP-4 Inhibitors, Pioglitazone
- May be considered based on individual patient needs, cost, and side effect profiles.

### Insulin
- If non-insulin therapies fail to achieve glycemic targets, initiate insulin (typically basal insulin first).

### Cardiovascular and Kidney Risk Reduction
- All patients should receive cardiovascular risk assessment and management (statin, ACEi/ARB for those with hypertension or albuminuria).
