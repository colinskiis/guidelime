## Scope

This guideline provides comprehensive recommendations for the diagnosis and management of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), addressing metabolic, reproductive, and psychological aspects.

## Key Recommendations

### Diagnosis
- Rotterdam criteria (2 of 3):
  - Oligo/anovulation
  - Clinical and/or biochemical hyperandrogenism
  - Polycystic ovarian morphology (ultrasound)
- Exclude secondary causes (thyroid, hyperprolactinemia, CAH)

### Phenotyping
- Phenotype A: Full syndrome (oligo + hyperandrogenism + PCOM)
- Phenotype B: Oligo + hyperandrogenism
- Phenotype C: Hyperandrogenism + PCOM
- Phenotype D: Oligo + PCOM (non-hyperandrogenic)

### Metabolic Assessment
- Screen for metabolic syndrome
- Oral glucose tolerance test preferred over HbA1c
- Lipid panel
- Screen for sleep apnea if symptomatic/obese

### Lifestyle Intervention
- First-line therapy for all phenotypes
- Target 5-10% weight loss if overweight/obese
- Structured exercise and dietary modification
- Behavioral support

### Pharmacologic Management
**Menstrual Regulation/Hyperandrogenism:**
- Combined oral contraceptives (first-line)
- Add spironolactone for additional anti-androgen effect
- Metformin as adjunct for metabolic features

**Infertility:**
- Letrozole as first-line ovulation induction
- Clomiphene citrate alternative
- Gonadotropins or IVF for refractory cases

**Metabolic:**
- Metformin for prediabetes/T2DM prevention
- GLP-1 receptor agonists for weight management

### Psychological Health
- Screen for anxiety and depression
- Address body image concerns
- Multidisciplinary support
