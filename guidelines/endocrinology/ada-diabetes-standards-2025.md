## Scope
The definitive 2025 annual update to the ADA Standards of Care, providing the most current evidence-based recommendations for the prevention, diagnosis, and management of all types of diabetes.

## Key Recommendations

### Diagnosis and Screening
- **Type 1 Diabetes (T1D)**: Recommends screening for T1D with islet autoantibodies in at-risk individuals to identify early stages (Stage 1 and 2) and enable early intervention (e.g., Teplizumab).
- **Type 2 Diabetes (T2D)**: Screening should begin at age 35 for all adults, and earlier in those with overweight/obesity and additional risk factors.

### Technology and Monitoring
- **Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM)**: Stronger emphasis on CGM for all adults with diabetes on intensive insulin therapy. 
- **Expanded CGM Use**: Now encourages the consideration of CGM for individuals with Type 2 diabetes *not* on insulin to improve self-management and glycemic awareness.

### Pharmacological Management of T2D
- **First-line Therapy**: Management should be individualized based on comorbidities, patient preferences, and social determinants of health.
- **Cardioprotection**: For patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), heart failure, or chronic kidney disease, a GLP-1 receptor agonist or SGLT2 inhibitor with proven benefit is recommended regardless of HbA1c.
- **GLP-1 Weight Benefits**: Highlights the importance of GLP-1 receptor agonists and dual GLP-1/GIP agonists (e.g., Tirzepatide) for weight management as a primary goal in T2D.

### Lifestyle and Behavioral Health
- **Resistance Training**: Recommends 2-3 sessions per week of resistance exercise to improve insulin sensitivity and muscle mass.
- **Cannabis**: Advise against recreational cannabis use in T1D due to a significantly increased risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).

### Complications and Comorbidities
- **CKD**: Finereone (nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist) is recommended for patients with CKD and T2D to reduce progression and CV events.
- **NAFLD/MASLD**: Screening for liver fibrosis is recommended in patients with T2D or obesity who have elevated liver enzymes.

### Individualized Care
- Stresses the "Cycle of Care" involving shared decision-making, patient-centered language, and addressing social determinants of health (SDOH) to improve outcomes and equity.
