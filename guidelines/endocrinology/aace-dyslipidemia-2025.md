## Scope
Comprehensive evidence-based update for the pharmacologic management of dyslipidemia in adults, focusing on risk-stratified treatment goals and the integration of newer lipid-lowering therapies.

## Key Recommendations

### Risk Categorization and LDL-C Targets
- **Extreme Risk**: (e.g., progressive ASCVD despite LDL <55, or ASCVD with T2D/CKD). **Target LDL-C: <40 mg/dL**.
- **Ultra-High Risk**: (e.g., recent ACS, symptomatic PAD/CAD/CVD). **Target LDL-C: <55 mg/dL**.
- **High Risk**: (e.g., T2D without other risk, or ≥2 risk factors). **Target LDL-C: <70 mg/dL**.

### Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)]
- **Universal Testing**: Recommends testing Lp(a) at least once in every adult's lifetime to identify individuals at high genetic cardiovascular risk. 
- **High Lp(a)**: A level >50 mg/dL (or >125 nmol/L) is considered a risk-enhancing factor that warrants more aggressive management of other lipids.

### Therapeutic Hierarchy
1. **Statins**: High-intensity statin therapy remains the first-line pharmacologic treatment.
2. **Ezetimibe**: Add if LDL-C goals are not reached on maximally tolerated statin.
3. **PCSK9 Inhibitors / siRNA**: Add (e.g., evolocumab, alirocumab, inclisiran) for patients at high or extreme risk who remain above target on statin + ezetimibe.
4. **Bempedoic Acid**: Consider for patients with statin intolerance or as add-on therapy.

### Triglyceride Management
- **Hypertriglyceridemia**: For patients with TG 150-499 mg/dL despite statin therapy and lifestyle, consider **Icosapent ethyl** to reduce cardiovascular risk.
- **Fibrates**: Discouraged as routine add-on to statins for CV risk reduction; reserve for severe hypertriglyceridemia (>500 mg/dL) to prevent pancreatitis.

### Special Populations
- **Diabetes**: Most patients with T2D aged 40–75 should be on at least moderate-intensity statin therapy regardless of baseline lipid levels.
- **CKD**: Statin therapy is recommended for patients with Stage 3-4 CKD.

### Monitoring
- Lipid panels should be repeated 4–12 weeks after starting or adjusting therapy, and then every 3–12 months based on stability and risk.
