## Scope
2024 NOF/ASBMR clinician's guide to the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis.

## Key Recommendations

### Screening
- **DXA (Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry)**: Recommended for women ≥65, men ≥70, and younger postmenopausal women or men 50-69 with risk factors.
- **FRAX (Fracture Risk Assessment Tool)**: Calculate 10-year probability of major osteoporotic and hip fracture to guide treatment decisions.

### Diagnosis
- **T-score ≤ -2.5** at lumbar spine, femoral neck, total hip, or 33% radius = Osteoporosis.
- **T-score -1.0 to -2.5** = Osteopenia (low bone mass).
- A hip or vertebral fracture = Clinical osteoporosis regardless of BMD.

### Treatment Thresholds
- Consider pharmacotherapy for:
  - T-score ≤ -2.5.
  - Low bone mass with 10-year FRAX probability ≥20% major osteoporotic fracture or ≥3% hip fracture.
  - History of hip or vertebral fracture.

### Lifestyle Measures (All Patients)
- Adequate calcium (1000-1200 mg/day total intake) and vitamin D (800-1000 IU/day or to achieve serum 25(OH)D ≥30 ng/mL).
- Weight-bearing and muscle-strengthening exercise.
- Fall prevention.
- Smoking cessation, limit alcohol.

### Pharmacotherapy

#### First-Line (Antiresorptive)
- **Bisphosphonates (Alendronate, Risedronate, Zoledronic Acid, Ibandronate)**: Oral or IV. Consider drug holiday after 3-5 years if low-moderate risk; continue in high-risk patients.
- **Denosumab (Prolia)**: RANKL inhibitor. Subcutaneous every 6 months. Caution: Do not discontinue abruptly (rebound bone loss/vertebral fractures); transition to bisphosphonate if stopping.

#### Anabolic Agents (For Very High-Risk Patients)
- **Romosozumab (Evenity)**: Sclerostin inhibitor. 12 monthly doses; consider for patients at imminent fracture risk. Avoid in patients with CV event in prior year.
- **Teriparatide (Forteo), Abaloparatide (Tymlos)**: PTH analogs. Daily injection x 2 years max. Follow with antiresorptive.

### Monitoring
- Repeat DXA every 1-2 years on treatment; bone turnover markers may guide response.
