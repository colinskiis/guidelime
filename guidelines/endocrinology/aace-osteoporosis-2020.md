## Scope
Evidence-based guidelines for diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis with updated recommendations on risk stratification and therapeutic options.

## Key Recommendations

### Diagnosis
- **DXA scan**: Gold standard for diagnosis
- **Osteoporosis**: T-score ≤-2.5 at spine, femoral neck, or total hip
- **Osteopenia**: T-score between -1.0 and -2.5
- Consider diagnosis with fragility fracture regardless of T-score

### Risk Stratification

#### High Risk
- T-score between -2.5 and -3.0
- Prior fragility fracture (hip or spine)
- FRAX 10-year probability: >20% major osteoporotic, >3% hip

#### Very High Risk
- T-score ≤-3.0
- Multiple vertebral fractures
- Recent fracture (within 12 months)
- Fracture while on approved osteoporosis therapy
- FRAX 10-year probability: >30% major osteoporotic, >4.5% hip

### Treatment Selection

#### High-Risk Patients (First-Line)
- **Bisphosphonates**: Alendronate, risedronate, zoledronic acid, ibandronate
- Oral bisphosphonates: Consider holiday after 5 years if no longer high-risk
- Zoledronic acid: Consider holiday after 3 years in high-risk patients

#### Very High-Risk Patients (First-Line)
- **Anabolic agents**: Romosozumab, teriparatide, abaloparatide
- After anabolic therapy, transition to antiresorptive therapy (bisphosphonate or denosumab)

#### Alternative Options
- **Denosumab**: Effective but requires transition plan (rebound bone loss if discontinued)
- **Raloxifene/Bazedoxifene**: For patients who cannot take bisphosphonates

### Bisphosphonate Drug Holidays
- **Oral bisphosphonates**: After 5 years (high-risk) or 6-10 years (very high-risk, stable)
- **Zoledronic acid**: After 3 years (high-risk) or 6 years (very high-risk)
- Reassess during holiday with DXA and fracture risk assessment
- Resume therapy if T-score declines significantly or fracture occurs

### Monitoring
- DXA every 1-2 years initially, less frequently once stable
- Serum CTX or P1NP for treatment response
- Vitamin D and calcium adequacy

### Calcium and Vitamin D
- Calcium: 1000-1200 mg/day (diet + supplements)
- Vitamin D: 1000-2000 IU/day (maintain 25(OH)D 30-50 ng/mL)
