## Scope

This guideline provides comprehensive recommendations for the diagnosis and management of obesity in adults.

## Key Recommendations

### Diagnosis and Staging
**BMI Classification:**
- Normal: 18.5-24.9 kg/m²
- Overweight: 25-29.9 kg/m²
- Obesity Class I: 30-34.9 kg/m²
- Obesity Class II: 35-39.9 kg/m²
- Obesity Class III: ≥40 kg/m²

**Complications-Centric Assessment:**
- Stage 0: No complications
- Stage 1: Mild complications
- Stage 2: Moderate complications
- Stage 3: Severe complications

### Lifestyle Intervention
- Comprehensive lifestyle program (diet, exercise, behavioral)
- Reduced calorie diet with macronutrient flexibility
- 150-300 min/week moderate physical activity
- Behavioral therapy and counseling

### Pharmacotherapy
**GLP-1 Receptor Agonists (First-Line):**
- Semaglutide 2.4mg weekly (highest efficacy)
- Tirzepatide (GLP-1/GIP dual agonist) (highest efficacy)
- Liraglutide 3.0mg daily

**Other Options:**
- Phentermine/topiramate ER
- Naltrexone/bupropion ER
- Orlistat
- Phentermine (short-term)

**When to Consider:**
- BMI ≥30 OR BMI ≥27 with obesity-related complication
- Adjunct to lifestyle modification

### Bariatric/Metabolic Surgery
**Indications:**
- BMI ≥40 OR BMI ≥35 with obesity-related complications
- Consider at lower BMI thresholds with metabolic disease

**Procedures:**
- Sleeve gastrectomy (most common)
- Roux-en-Y gastric bypass
- One anastomosis gastric bypass
- Endoscopic procedures for select patients

### Complications Management
- Treat associated conditions (T2DM, hypertension, dyslipidemia, OSA)
- Weight loss improves cardiometabolic parameters
- Medication adjustment as weight changes

### Maintenance
- Long-term follow-up essential
- Address weight regain proactively
- Consider ongoing pharmacotherapy for weight maintenance
