## Scope

This guideline provides recommendations for the diagnosis and management of primary adrenal insufficiency in adults and children.

## Key Recommendations

### Diagnosis
- Morning serum cortisol and ACTH
- Low cortisol (<5 µg/dL) + elevated ACTH diagnostic
- ACTH stimulation test for borderline cases
- 21-hydroxylase antibodies to identify autoimmune etiology
- Adrenal CT for other etiologies

### Glucocorticoid Replacement
**Adults:**
- Hydrocortisone 15-25 mg/day in 2-3 divided doses
- Largest dose in morning, mimicking circadian rhythm
- Prednisolone 3-5 mg/day alternative (once daily)

**Children:**
- Hydrocortisone 8-10 mg/m²/day in 3 divided doses
- Avoid excessive dosing (growth suppression)

### Mineralocorticoid Replacement
- Fludrocortisone 50-200 µg daily
- Monitor BP, potassium, plasma renin
- Adjust as needed; may need higher doses with hydrocortisone

### Stress Dosing ("Sick Day Rules")
- Minor illness: Double or triple glucocorticoid dose
- Major illness/surgery: IV hydrocortisone 50-100mg bolus, then 200mg/24hr continuous or divided q6h
- Taper back to maintenance over days as condition improves

### Adrenal Crisis
- Emergency: Hydrocortisone 100mg IV stat, then 200mg/24hr
- IV saline resuscitation
- Treat precipitating cause
- Medical alert identification essential

### Monitoring
- Clinical assessment (fatigue, weight, BP)
- Electrolytes
- Plasma renin activity for mineralocorticoid dosing
- No reliable marker for glucocorticoid adequacy

### Patient Education
- Emergency injection training
- Medical alert bracelet/card
- Sick day rules
- Carry emergency kit (injectable hydrocortisone)
