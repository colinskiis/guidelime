## Scope
2024 ADA Standards of Care section on the prevention and treatment of hypoglycemia in people with diabetes.

## Key Recommendations

### Definition (Glucose Levels)
- **Level 1 (Alert)**: <70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L).
- **Level 2 (Clinically Significant)**: <54 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L).
- **Level 3 (Severe)**: Event requiring assistance from another person.

### Risk Factors
- Insulin or sulfonylurea use.
- Impaired hypoglycemia awareness.
- Renal or hepatic insufficiency.
- Older age, cognitive impairment.
- Alcohol use, fasting, increased physical activity.

### Prevention
- Set individualized glycemic targets to minimize hypoglycemia risk.
- **CGM or Frequent SMBG**: For patients on insulin.
- **Insulin Dose Adjustment**: Reduce basal or bolus insulin as needed.
- Avoid sulfonylureas or glinides when possible in high-risk patients; consider SGLT2i, GLP-1 RA, or DPP-4i instead.
- Patient education on hypoglycemia recognition and treatment.

### Treatment

#### Mild-Moderate Hypoglycemia (Patient Able to Self-Treat)
- **15-20 g Fast-Acting Carbohydrate**: Glucose tablets (preferred), juice, regular soda, candy.
- Recheck glucose in 15 minutes; repeat if still <70 mg/dL ("Rule of 15").
- Follow with snack or meal once glucose normalized.

#### Severe Hypoglycemia (Requires Assistance)
- **Glucagon**: Administer immediately if patient is unable to swallow.
  - **IM/SC Glucagon Kit** (reconstitute and inject).
  - **Nasal Glucagon (Baqsimi)**: 3 mg intranasal.
  - **Glucagon Autoinjector (Gvoke)**: 0.5-1 mg SC.
- Once responsive, give oral carbs.
- Emergency medical services if severe, prolonged, or unclear cause.

### Impaired Hypoglycemia Awareness
- Increase glucose targets.
- Consider CGM with alarms.
- Structured education programs (BGAT, HypoAWARE).
- Insulin pump with predictive low-glucose suspend or automated insulin delivery.
