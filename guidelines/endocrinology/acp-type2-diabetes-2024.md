## Scope
Updated evidence-based recommendations on the use of newer pharmacological treatments (SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 agonists) in adults with type 2 diabetes.

## Key Recommendations

### Recommendation 1
- **Metformin and Lifestyle**: ACP recommends that clinicians provide metformin and lifestyle interventions as first-line treatment for adults with type 2 diabetes.

### Recommendation 2 (New for 2024)
- **Add-on Therapy**: ACP recommends adding a **sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor** or **glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist** to metformin and lifestyle interventions in adults with type 2 diabetes and inadequate glycemic control.
- **Goal**: Prioritize these agents to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), congestive heart failure (CHF) hospitalizations, and chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression.

### Clinical Considerations
- **SGLT-2 Inhibitor Selection**: Preferred in patients with or at high risk for CHF or CKD.
- **GLP-1 Agonist Selection**: Preferred in patients with or at high risk for MACE.
- **DPP-4 Inhibitors**: Recommend against the use of DPP-4 inhibitors as add-on therapy, as they do not provide the same cardiovascular or renal benefits as SGLT-2 or GLP-1 agents.

### Cost and Access
- Acknowledge that while these newer agents provide significant clinical benefit, cost and insurance coverage remain significant barriers for many patients.
- Discussion with patients regarding out-of-pocket costs is encouraged.
