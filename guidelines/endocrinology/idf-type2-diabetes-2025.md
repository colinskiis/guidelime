## Scope
Global recommendations for the management of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in diverse clinical settings, focusing on cost-effective care and preventing complications.

## Key Recommendations

### Diagnosis and Screening
- **Screening**: Opportunistic screening for adults with risk factors (e.g., age, obesity, family history).
- **Diagnostic Criteria**: FPG ≥7.0 mmol/L (126 mg/dL) or HbA1c ≥6.5% (48 mmol/mol) or 2h-PG ≥11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL).

### Foundations of Care
- **Diabetes Education**: Structured diabetes self-management education and support (DSMES) for all individuals.
- **Healthy Lifestyle**: Focus on healthy diet, physical activity, and weight management as the foundation for all treatment.

### Glycemic Targets
- **Individualization**: General HbA1c target <7.0% (53 mmol/mol), but should be individualized based on duration of diabetes, age, comorbidities, and hypoglycemia risk.

### Pharmacological Management
- **First-line**: Metformin remains the preferred initial pharmacological agent.
- **Second-line/Combination**: Choice of second agent should be based on clinical characteristics (e.g., SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 agonists for those with CVD or CKD).
- **Insulin**: Guidance on timely initiation of basal insulin when non-insulin therapies are insufficient.

### Preventing Complications
- **Blood Pressure**: Target <130/80 mmHg using ACE inhibitors or ARBs as preferred agents.
- **Lipids**: Statin therapy for primary and secondary prevention of CVD.
- **Foot Care**: Annual foot screening for all individuals to prevent ulcers and amputations.
- **Eye Care**: Regular retinal screening (every 1-2 years) to detect retinopathy.
- **Kidney Care**: Annual screening for albuminuria and eGFR.

### Special Populations
- **Elderly**: Focus on quality of life and avoiding hypoglycemia.
- **Pregnancy**: Managing pre-existing T2D and gestational diabetes (GDM).
