## Scope

This guideline provides recommendations for the evaluation and management of thyroid nodules discovered clinically or incidentally on imaging.

## Key Recommendations

### Initial Evaluation
- TSH measurement for all patients
- Neck ultrasound as first imaging modality
- Risk stratification using ultrasound pattern

### Ultrasound Risk Stratification (ACR TI-RADS)
- TR1: Benign (no FNA needed)
- TR2: Not suspicious
- TR3: Mildly suspicious
- TR4: Moderately suspicious
- TR5: Highly suspicious

### FNA Recommendations
- Based on size and TI-RADS score
- Generally ≥1 cm for suspicious nodules
- Larger size thresholds for lower-risk patterns
- Defer FNA for purely cystic/spongiform nodules

### Cytopathology (Bethesda System)
- I: Nondiagnostic - Repeat FNA
- II: Benign - Surveillance
- III: AUS/FLUS - Repeat FNA or molecular testing
- IV: Follicular neoplasm - Molecular testing or lobectomy
- V: Suspicious for malignancy - Surgery
- VI: Malignant - Surgery

### Molecular Testing
- Consider for Bethesda III-IV to guide management
- Afirma, ThyroSeq, or equivalent platforms
- Helps avoid diagnostic surgery

### Surveillance for Benign Nodules
- Repeat ultrasound at 12-24 months initially
- Decrease frequency if stable
- Re-biopsy if significant growth (>20% in 2 dimensions)

### Incidental Findings
- Sub-centimeter nodules: Generally no workup unless high-risk features
- FDG-avid nodules on PET: Higher malignancy risk, FNA recommended

### Special Situations
- Pregnancy: Defer FNA/surgery if possible to second trimester
- Hyperfunctioning nodules: Low malignancy risk; treat hyperthyroidism
