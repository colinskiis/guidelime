## Scope
First WHO official guideline on the long-term use of GLP-1 receptor agonists (such as semaglutide and liraglutide) for the management of obesity in adults.

## Key Recommendations

### General Approach
- **Obesity as a Chronic Disease**: WHO recognizes obesity as a chronic, relapsing disease requiring lifelong, multidisciplinary care.
- **Multimodal Treatment**: GLP-1 therapies should be part of a comprehensive management plan including:
  - Healthy diets
  - Regular physical activity
  - Psychosocial support
  - Professional clinical monitoring

### Indications for GLP-1 Use
- **Eligibility**: Recommended for adults with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of **≥30 kg/m²**.
- **Comorbidity-linked Eligibility**: Also recommended for adults with a BMI of **≥27 kg/m²** when accompanied by at least one weight-related comorbidity (e.g., hypertension, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia).

### Duration and Continuity
- **Long-term Use**: Suggests long-term (potentially lifelong) use of GLP-1 receptor agonists for sustained weight loss and health improvement.
- **Monitoring**: Regular assessment of efficacy, safety, and patient tolerance is required.

### Contraindications and Cautions
- **Pregnancy**: Specifically excludes use during pregnancy.
- **History of Medullary Thyroid Cancer**: Standard caution for GLP-1 class.
- **Pancreatitis History**: Monitor closely or avoid in patients with prior history.

### Public Health Considerations
- **Access and Equity**: Emphasizes the need for equitable access to these medications globally.
- **Cost-Effectiveness**: Encourages health systems to integrate obesity management into primary health care.
