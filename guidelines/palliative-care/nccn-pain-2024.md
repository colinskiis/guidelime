## Scope

This guideline provides recommendations for the assessment and management of pain in adult cancer patients across all stages of disease.

## Key Recommendations

### Pain Assessment
- Comprehensive pain assessment (location, quality, intensity, timing)
- Numeric rating scale (0-10)
- Identify pain mechanism (nociceptive, neuropathic, mixed)
- Assess psychosocial factors
- Regular reassessment

### Mild Pain (1-3/10)
- Acetaminophen
- NSAIDs (if appropriate)
- Adjuvant analgesics as indicated
- Consider opioids if non-opioids inadequate

### Moderate to Severe Pain (4-10/10)
**Opioid Selection:**
- Morphine, oxycodone, hydromorphone first-line
- Fentanyl for dysphagia or GI issues
- Methadone for complex pain (specialist consultation)
- Avoid meperidine and codeine

**Titration:**
- Start low, titrate to effect
- Immediate-release for initial titration
- Convert to extended-release once stable
- Breakthrough dosing: 10-15% of 24-hour dose

### Neuropathic Pain
- Gabapentin or pregabalin
- Duloxetine
- Tricyclic antidepressants (cautiously)
- Combine with opioids for mixed pain

### Bone Pain
- Opioids + adjuvants
- NSAIDs
- Bisphosphonates or denosumab
- Radiotherapy for localized bone metastases
- Corticosteroids for cord compression

### Breakthrough Pain
- Rapid-onset opioids (oral, buccal, sublingual, nasal fentanyl)
- Immediate-release opioids

### Non-Pharmacologic
- Physical therapy
- Interventional procedures (nerve blocks, intrathecal pumps)
- Radiation for localized disease
- Psychological support

### Opioid Side Effects
- Prophylactic bowel regimen (stimulant + softener)
- Antiemetics PRN during initiation
- Monitor for sedation, respiratory depression
