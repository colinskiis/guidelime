## Scope
Comprehensive five-year update to the standards for Basic Life Support (BLS), Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support (ACLS), and Pediatric Advanced Life Support (PALS), incorporating new evidence and streamlining resuscitation workflows.

## Key Recommendations

### Unified Chain of Survival
- **New Paradigm**: Introduces a single, unified six-link Chain of Survival for all ages and locations:
  1. Early Recognition and Activation.
  2. High-Quality CPR.
  3. Rapid Defibrillation.
  4. Advanced Resuscitation.
  5. Post-Cardiac Arrest Care.
  6. Recovery.

### Basic Life Support (BLS)
- **Compression Rate**: Maintains 100-120 compressions per minute for all ages.
- **Compression Depth**: 
  - Adults: At least 2 inches (5 cm).
  - Children: At least 1/3 the chest depth (~2 inches/5 cm).
  - Infants: At least 1/3 the chest depth (~1.5 inches/4 cm).
- **Infant Compressions**: Standardizes on the two-thumb encircling hands technique or the heel of one hand; the two-finger technique is no longer recommended.
- **Rescue Breathing**: For patients with a pulse but not breathing normally: 1 breath every 6 seconds (10 breaths/min) for all ages.

### Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support (ACLS)
- **Epinephrine**: Should be administered as soon as possible for non-shockable rhythms (asystole/PEA). For shockable rhythms, it is typically given after the second shock.
- **Mechanical CPR**: Recommends against the routine use of mechanical chest compression devices; they may be considered in specific settings (e.g., during transport or PCI) where high-quality manual CPR is not feasible.

### Management of Choking (All Ages)
- **Adults and Children**: Alternate 5 back blows with 5 abdominal thrusts (Heimlich maneuver) until the object is expelled or the person becomes unresponsive.
- **Infants**: Alternate 5 back blows with 5 chest thrusts. Abdominal thrusts are contraindicated in infants.

### Opioid-Associated Emergencies
- **Naloxone**: Expanded emphasis on rapid administration for victims of suspected opioid overdose.
- **Public Access**: Recommends widespread availability of opioid emergency kits in public spaces and high-risk environments.

### Health Equity
- **Commitment**: New emphasis on ensuring equitable access to bystander CPR training and timely advanced care in all communities, particularly those with historically lower outcomes.
