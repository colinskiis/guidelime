## Scope

This guideline provides updated recommendations for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and emergency cardiovascular care for lay rescuers and healthcare providers.

## Key Recommendations

### Basic Life Support (BLS)
**Chain of Survival:**
1. Early recognition and activation
2. Early CPR with emphasis on chest compressions
3. Rapid defibrillation
4. Effective advanced resuscitation
5. Post-cardiac arrest care
6. Recovery

**High-Quality CPR:**
- Compression rate: 100-120/min
- Compression depth: At least 2 inches (5 cm) in adults
- Full chest recoil between compressions
- Minimize interruptions (<10 seconds)
- C:V ratio: 30:2 (untrained rescuers: compression-only CPR acceptable)

### Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support (ACLS)
**Shockable Rhythms (VF/pVT):**
- Defibrillation as soon as available
- Resume CPR immediately after shock
- Epinephrine 1mg IV/IO after second shock, then q3-5 min
- Amiodarone 300mg (repeat 150mg) or lidocaine

**Non-Shockable Rhythms (Asystole/PEA):**
- CPR + epinephrine as soon as IV/IO access
- Identify reversible causes (Hs and Ts)

### Hs and Ts
- Hypovolemia, Hypoxia, Hydrogen ion (acidosis), Hypo/hyperkalemia, Hypothermia
- Tension pneumothorax, Tamponade (cardiac), Toxins, Thrombosis (pulmonary/coronary)

### Pediatric Resuscitation
- Compression depth: 1/3 AP chest diameter
- Ventilation more important than in adults
- Two-rescuer: 15:2 compression-to-ventilation ratio

### Post-Cardiac Arrest Care
- Targeted temperature management (32-36°C)
- PCI for STEMI/high suspicion coronary occlusion
- Avoid hyperoxia; target SpO2 92-98%
- Blood pressure optimization (MAP >65-70)
- Multimodal neuroprognostication (≥72 hours)

### In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest
- Early warning systems and rapid response teams
- Emphasis on high-quality CPR and early defibrillation
- Extracorporeal CPR (ECPR) for selected patients
