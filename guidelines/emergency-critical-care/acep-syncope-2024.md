## Scope
2024 ACEP clinical policy update on the evaluation and management of adult patients presenting to the ED with syncope.

## Key Recommendations

### Initial Assessment
- Focused history: Prodrome, position, activity, witnesses, medications, cardiac history.
- Physical examination: Vital signs, orthostatic BP, cardiac exam, neurologic exam.
- **12-Lead ECG**: Required in all patients with syncope.

### Risk Stratification
- Use clinical judgment supplemented by validated risk tools.
- **Canadian Syncope Risk Score (CSRS)** or **San Francisco Syncope Rule**: May help identify high-risk patients.
- **High-Risk Features**:
  - Abnormal ECG (arrhythmia, new ischemia, conduction disease).
  - History of cardiac disease or structural heart disease.
  - Syncope during exertion or while supine.
  - Significant comorbidities.
  - Older age with unexplained syncope.

### Diagnostic Testing
- **Routine Labs**: Not recommended unless clinically indicated (anemia, hypoglycemia, electrolyte concern).
- **Echocardiography**: If structural heart disease suspected.
- **Cardiac Monitoring**: Consider for intermediate-to-high-risk patients (telemetry, Holter, event monitor).
- **CT Head, EEG**: NOT routinely indicated unless focal neurologic findings or seizure suspected.

### Disposition
- **Low-Risk Patients**: May be safely discharged with outpatient follow-up.
- **High-Risk Patients**: Admission for cardiac monitoring, further evaluation, and management.
- **Intermediate-Risk**: Consider observation unit, expedited outpatient workup, or short admission based on clinical context.

### Patient Counseling
- Driving restrictions based on etiology and local regulations.
- Return precautions.
