## Scope
2024 update to the ACEP clinical policy on the ED evaluation and management of adult patients with suspected sepsis or septic shock.

## Key Recommendations

### Identification and Screening
- Use a standardized screening tool (e.g., SIRS, qSOFA, NEWS) to identify patients at risk, but recognize limitations of each.
- qSOFA (≥2 of: RR≥22, altered mentation, SBP≤100) identifies high-risk patients but has lower sensitivity than SIRS.

### Lactate Measurement
- **Recommendation**: Obtain a serum lactate level in patients with suspected sepsis. Elevated lactate (>2 mmol/L) indicates tissue hypoperfusion and higher mortality risk.
- Repeat lactate if initially elevated to guide resuscitation.

### Antibiotics
- **Early Antibiotics**: Administer broad-spectrum antibiotics as early as possible, ideally within 1 hour of sepsis recognition, especially for septic shock.
- Obtain blood cultures BEFORE antibiotics if it does not significantly delay treatment.

### Fluid Resuscitation
- **Initial Resuscitation**: Administer 30 mL/kg of IV crystalloid for hypotension or lactate ≥4 mmol/L.
- Reassess volume status and tissue perfusion frequently. Avoid fluid overload, particularly in patients with heart failure or ESRD.

### Vasopressors
- If hypotension persists despite fluid resuscitation, start vasopressors (norepinephrine first-line) to target MAP ≥65 mmHg.

### Source Control
- Identify and control the source of infection (e.g., drainage of abscess, removal of infected device) as quickly as possible.

### Disposition
- Patients with septic shock or organ dysfunction require ICU admission. Patients with uncomplicated sepsis may be candidates for observation or floor admission depending on response to treatment.
