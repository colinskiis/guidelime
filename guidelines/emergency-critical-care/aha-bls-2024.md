## Scope
2024 AHA guidelines update on Basic Life Support (BLS) for adult out-of-hospital and in-hospital cardiac arrest.

## Key Recommendations

### Chain of Survival
1. Early recognition and activation of emergency response (call 911).
2. Early CPR with emphasis on chest compressions.
3. Rapid defibrillation.
4. Advanced life support.
5. Post-cardiac arrest care.
6. Recovery.

### High-Quality CPR (Most Critical Intervention)
- **Compression Rate**: 100-120 compressions per minute.
- **Compression Depth**: At least 2 inches (5 cm) for adults.
- **Full Chest Recoil**: Allow complete chest recoil between compressions.
- **Minimize Interruptions**: Limit pauses in chest compressions to <10 seconds.
- **Compression-to-Ventilation Ratio**: 30:2 for single rescuer; continuous compressions with ventilations every 6 seconds if advanced airway in place.

### Automated External Defibrillator (AED)
- Use as soon as available.
- Turn on AED, follow voice prompts, attach pads, allow analysis, and deliver shock if advised.
- Resume CPR immediately after shock for 2 minutes before rhythm recheck.

### Compression-Only CPR (Hands-Only)
- Recommended for untrained bystanders or those unwilling/unable to provide rescue breaths.
- Push hard and fast in center of chest.
- Effective for witnessed sudden cardiac arrest (shockable rhythm).

### Rescue Breathing
- If trained, provide 2 breaths after every 30 compressions.
- Each breath should take ~1 second and produce visible chest rise.

### Special Considerations
- **Opioid Overdose**: If suspected, administer naloxone (if available) in addition to standard BLS.
- **Drowning**: Begin with ventilations due to hypoxic cause.
- **Pregnancy**: Standard CPR; manual left uterine displacement if visibly pregnant.

### Team Dynamics
- If multiple rescuers, rotate compressors every 2 minutes to prevent fatigue.
