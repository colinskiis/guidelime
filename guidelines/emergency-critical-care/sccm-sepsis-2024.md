## Scope

This guideline update provides recommendations for the management of sepsis and septic shock in adults, emphasizing early recognition, resuscitation, and antimicrobial stewardship.

## Key Recommendations

### Screening and Early Detection
- Systematic screening for sepsis in acute care settings
- Lactate measurement for sepsis identification
- SOFA score for organ dysfunction assessment

### Initial Resuscitation
- Begin resuscitation immediately upon recognition
- Initial crystalloid bolus of 30 mL/kg within 3 hours for hypotension/lactate ≥4
- Reassess volume status and tissue perfusion dynamically
- Balanced crystalloids preferred over normal saline

### Antimicrobial Therapy
- Administer within 1 hour of sepsis recognition (3 hours for sepsis without shock)
- Empiric broad-spectrum coverage; narrow based on cultures
- De-escalation within 24-48 hours when feasible
- Duration: 5-7 days adequate for most infections

### Vasopressors
- Norepinephrine as first-line vasopressor
- Target MAP 65 mmHg
- Vasopressin as second-line or norepinephrine-sparing agent
- Epinephrine for refractory shock

### Corticosteroids
- IV hydrocortisone 200mg/day for septic shock requiring escalating vasopressors
- Taper when vasopressors discontinued

### Source Control
- Prompt identification and intervention
- Drainage, debridement, or device removal as indicated
- Ideally within 6-12 hours of diagnosis

### Organ Support
- Lung-protective ventilation for ARDS
- Conservative fluid management after initial resuscitation
- Renal replacement therapy: Conventional indications
- Glucose control: Target 144-180 mg/dL

### Special Populations
- Pediatric sepsis: Separate guideline available
- Immunocompromised: Broader empiric coverage
