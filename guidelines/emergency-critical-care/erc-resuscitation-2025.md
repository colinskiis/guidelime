## Scope
Comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and post-resuscitation care, covering basic and advanced life support for adults, children, and neonates.

## Key Recommendations

### Systems Saving Lives
- **Universal Responsibility**: Everyone in society should be able to recognize cardiac arrest and start CPR.
- **Early Activation**: Call emergency services (112) for any unresponsive person *before* assessing breathing.
- **Technology Integration**: Effective use of apps/maps to find the nearest AED and alert nearby first responders.

### Adult Basic Life Support (BLS)
- **Recognition**: Unresponsive and not breathing normally.
- **Chest Compressions**: 
  - Depth: 5-6 cm.
  - Rate: 100-120 per minute.
  - Individualized depth adjustment may be considered based on body mass.
- **Defibrillation**: Use an AED as soon as available. Follow voice prompts.
- **Rescue Breaths**: 30:2 ratio (if trained). If untrained, perform compression-only CPR.

### Adult Advanced Life Support (ALS)
- **High-Quality CPR**: Minimize interruptions in chest compressions (aim for compression fraction >60%).
- **Defibrillation**: Standard 150-200 J (biphasic) for adult shockable rhythms (VF/pVT).
- **Airway**: Use the most effective technique with which the team is most proficient (BVM vs. SGA vs. ETT).
- **Drugs**:
  - **Adrenaline**: 1 mg every 3-5 mins. 
    - Give as soon as possible in non-shockable rhythms (PEA/Asystole).
    - Give after the 3rd shock in shockable rhythms.
  - **Amiodarone**: 300 mg after 3rd shock; 150 mg after 5th shock.

### Pediatric and Neonatal Life Support
- **Ventilation Priority**: Most pediatric arrests are respiratory in origin; rescue breaths are crucial.
- **Compression-to-Ventilation Ratio**: 15:2 recommended for two-person resuscitation in children.

### Post-Resuscitation Care
- **Targeted Temperature Management (TTM)**: Maintain a constant temperature (e.g., 32-36°C) or prevent fever (>37.5°C) for at least 24 hours depending on the scenario.
- **Neuroprognostication**: Use a multimodal approach at least 72 hours after ROSC.

### Ethics and Recovery
- **Shared Decision-Making**: Early discussions about treatment goals and DNR orders.
- **Family Presence**: Allow family presence during resuscitation with dedicated support.
- **Rehabilitation**: All survivors should have a structured follow-up and rehabilitation plan.
