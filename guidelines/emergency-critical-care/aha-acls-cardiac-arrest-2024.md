## Scope
2024 AHA guidelines update on Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support (ACLS) for adult cardiac arrest.

## Key Recommendations

### High-Quality CPR
- Remains the foundation of resuscitation.
- Minimize interruptions; compression fraction >80%.
- Quantitative waveform capnography: ETCO2 <10 mmHg may indicate poor CPR quality or low likelihood of ROSC.

### Shockable Rhythms (VF/pVT)

#### Defibrillation
- Shock immediately when VF/pVT identified.
- Biphasic: Manufacturer-recommended dose (120-200 J); if unknown, use maximum.
- Resume CPR immediately for 2 minutes after each shock.

#### Medications
- **Epinephrine 1 mg IV/IO**: Every 3-5 minutes.
- **Amiodarone 300 mg IV/IO** (1st dose), then 150 mg (2nd dose): For refractory VF/pVT.
- **Lidocaine**: Alternative to amiodarone.

### Non-Shockable Rhythms (PEA/Asystole)
- **Epinephrine 1 mg IV/IO**: As soon as feasible, repeat every 3-5 minutes.
- Identify and treat reversible causes (H's and T's).
- No role for shock unless rhythm changes to shockable.

### H's and T's (Reversible Causes)
- **H's**: Hypovolemia, Hypoxia, Hydrogen ion (acidosis), Hypo/Hyperkalemia, Hypothermia.
- **T's**: Tension pneumothorax, Tamponade (cardiac), Toxins, Thrombosis (pulmonary or coronary).

### Airway Management
- BVM with 100% O2 initially.
- Advanced airway (ETT or supraglottic): Once placed, continuous compressions with 1 breath every 6 seconds.
- Avoid excessive ventilation.

### ROSC (Return of Spontaneous Circulation)
- Confirm pulse and organized rhythm.
- Optimize oxygenation/ventilation.
- Treat hypotension (fluids, vasopressors).
- 12-lead ECG; consider emergent coronary angiography for STEMI or suspected cardiac etiology.
- Targeted temperature management (32-36°C) for comatose survivors.

### Post-Arrest Care
- ICU admission, neuroprognostication, address etiology.
