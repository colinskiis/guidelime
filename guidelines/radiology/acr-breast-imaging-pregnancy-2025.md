## Scope
Updated evidence-based appropriateness criteria for the evaluation of clinical symptoms (e.g., palpable mass, nipple discharge) and screening in individuals who are pregnant or lactating.

## Key Recommendations

### Initial Evaluation of Palpable Mass
- **Ultrasound (US)**: **Usually Appropriate** and is the preferred first-line imaging modality for Any age patient who is pregnant or lactating presenting with a palpable mass or focal symptoms. US has no ionizing radiation and high sensitivity in this population.

### Mammography and Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT)
- **Diagnostic Mammography**: **Usually Appropriate** as a secondary step if US is suspicious (BI-RADS 4 or 5) or if ultrasound is negative but clinical suspicion remains high. 
- **Fetal Safety**: With modern shielding and standard protocols, the radiation dose to the fetus from mammography is negligible (far below the threshold for malformations or miscarriage).

### Breast MRI
- **Pregnancy**: **Usually Not Appropriate** during pregnancy due to concerns regarding gadolinium contrast crossing the placenta.
- **Lactation**: **Usually Appropriate** if there is a strong clinical indication (e.g., staging of newly diagnosed cancer). Patients do not need to interrupt breastfeeding after gadolinium administration, as the amount excreted in breast milk is extremely low (<0.01% of maternal dose).

### Biopsy
- **Recommendation**: If imaging is suspicious, ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy is **Usually Appropriate** and safe during both pregnancy and lactation.
- **Safety**: Increased risk of bleeding or milk fistula (during lactation) is minimal; standard pressure and local anesthesia are sufficient.

### Screening
- **Pregnancy**: Routine screening mammography is generally deferred until after delivery unless the patient is at extremely high risk.
- **Lactation**: Screening mammography is appropriate, though sensitivity may be slightly decreased due to increased breast density. It is often recommended to breastfeed or pump immediately prior to the imaging to reduce density.
