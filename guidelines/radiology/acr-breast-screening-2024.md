## Scope
2024 ACR appropriateness criteria update on breast cancer screening in women at average and elevated risk.

## Key Recommendations

### Average-Risk Women
- **Start Age**: Annual screening mammography starting at age 40.
- **Modality**: Digital mammography or digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT, 3D mammography).
- **Interval**: Annual screening is recommended.
- **No Upper Age Limit**: Continue screening as long as life expectancy is ≥5-7 years.

### Dense Breasts
- Women with heterogeneously or extremely dense breasts on mammography have reduced mammographic sensitivity.
- **Supplemental Screening**: Consider breast ultrasound or abbreviated breast MRI (AB-MRI) as adjuncts for women with dense breasts and average risk.

### High-Risk Women (≥20% Lifetime Risk)
- **MRI Screening**: Annual breast MRI in addition to mammography is recommended.
- **Risk Factors**: BRCA1/2 or other high-penetrance gene mutations, history of chest radiation (e.g., Hodgkin lymphoma), strong family history (per risk models like Tyrer-Cuzick, BRCAPRO).
- Start MRI screening at age 25-30 (or earlier based on family history).

### Intermediate-Risk Women (15-20% Lifetime Risk)
- Discuss supplemental screening (MRI or US) on an individualized basis.

### Genetic Testing Referral
- Consider referral for genetic counseling and testing for women with concerning personal or family history.

### Risk Assessment
- Perform lifetime risk assessment to identify women who qualify for enhanced screening protocols.
