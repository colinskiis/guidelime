## Scope
Comprehensive guidance on the safe and effective use of contrast media in radiology, including iodinated, gadolinium-based, and other contrast agents.

## Key Recommendations

### Adverse Reactions

#### Acute Reactions to Iodinated Contrast
| Severity | Symptoms |
|----------|----------|
| Mild | Nausea, vomiting, urticaria (limited), warmth |
| Moderate | Severe vomiting, extensive urticaria, facial edema, bronchospasm |
| Severe | Hypotension, cardiac arrest, severe bronchospasm, laryngeal edema |

#### Risk Factors for Reaction
- Previous reaction to contrast (strongest predictor)
- Asthma (especially if unstable)
- Multiple severe allergies
- Mastocytosis

#### Premedication Protocol
For patients at increased risk:
| Medication | Regimen |
|------------|---------|
| Prednisone | 50 mg PO at 13, 7, and 1 hour before |
| Diphenhydramine | 50 mg PO/IV/IM 1 hour before |

**Alternative (accelerated):**
- Methylprednisolone 40 mg IV or hydrocortisone 200 mg IV at 4 hours and 1 hour before
- Plus diphenhydramine

### Contrast-Induced AKI (Post-Contrast AKI)

#### Definition
- Rise in serum creatinine ≥0.3 mg/dL or ≥50% from baseline within 48-72 hours

#### Risk Assessment
| eGFR | IV Iodinated Contrast Risk |
|------|---------------------------|
| ≥45 mL/min | Very low risk |
| 30-44 mL/min | Low risk |
| <30 mL/min | Moderate-higher risk (consider alternatives) |

#### Prevention Strategies
- Ensure adequate hydration
- Use lowest effective dose
- Avoid repeat contrast within 24-48 hours if possible
- Consider alternatives (non-contrast, ultrasound, MRI)

#### Metformin Considerations
| eGFR | Recommendation |
|------|----------------|
| ≥30 mL/min | Continue metformin; no need to hold |
| <30 mL/min | Hold metformin 48 hours; restart after confirming stable renal function |

### Gadolinium-Based Contrast Agents

#### Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis (NSF)
- Occurs almost exclusively with severe renal impairment
- Associated primarily with Group I agents (highest risk)

#### Agent Classification by NSF Risk
| Group | Risk | Agents |
|-------|------|--------|
| Group I | Highest risk | Gadodiamide, gadopentetate dimeglumine, gadoversetamide |
| Group II | Low risk | Gadobenate, gadobutrol, gadoterate, gadoteridol |
| Group III | Limited data | Gadoxetate, ferumoxytol |

#### Recommendations by Renal Function
- eGFR ≥30: Group II agents safe
- eGFR <30 or on dialysis: Use Group II agents; avoid Group I

### Extravasation

#### Prevention
- Proper IV technique
- Use power injectors appropriately
- Avoid sites prone to extravasation

#### Management
| Severity | Treatment |
|----------|-----------|
| Small volume | Elevate, ice, observe |
| Large volume or symptoms | Plastic surgery consultation if needed |

### Special Populations

#### Pregnancy
- Iodinated contrast: Use only if benefit outweighs risk
- Gadolinium: Avoid unless essential (crosses placenta)
- No special neonatal testing required after in-utero exposure

#### Breastfeeding
- Iodinated contrast: Continue breastfeeding (minimal excretion)
- Gadolinium: Continue breastfeeding (minimal excretion)

#### Pediatric Patients
- Weight-based dosing
- Same premedication protocols (adjusted doses)
- Higher threshold for contrast use

### Allergic-Like Reaction Management

#### Mild Reactions
- Usually self-limited
- Observation
- Antihistamines for urticaria

#### Moderate Reactions
- Epinephrine 0.3 mg IM for bronchospasm
- IV fluids
- Antihistamines, bronchodilators

#### Severe Reactions (Anaphylaxis)
1. Epinephrine 0.3-0.5 mg IM (repeat every 5-15 min as needed)
2. IV access, fluids
3. Oxygen
4. H1/H2 blockers
5. Call code if cardiovascular collapse

### Hyperthyroidism Considerations

#### Iodinated Contrast and Thyroid
- May precipitate thyroid storm in uncontrolled hyperthyroidism
- May interfere with I-131 therapy (delay 4-8 weeks)

#### Recommendations
- Proceed with caution in known/suspected hyperthyroidism
- Consult endocrinology if uncontrolled
- Consider alternatives

### Oral Contrast

#### Indications
- GI tract evaluation
- Enteric vs. abscess differentiation
- Leak/fistula assessment

#### Types
- Barium sulfate (routine GI studies)
- Water-soluble (Gastrografin) if perforation risk
