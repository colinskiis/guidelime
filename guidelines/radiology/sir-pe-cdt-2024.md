## Scope
2024 multidisciplinary expert opinion from SIR and SVS on the role of catheter-directed therapy (CDT) for acute high-risk and intermediate-high-risk pulmonary embolism (PE).

## Key Recommendations

### Patient Selection
- **High-Risk PE (Massive PE)**: Defined by sustained hypotension (SBP <90 mmHg) or obstructive shock. Systemic thrombolysis is first-line, but CDT is an alternative if thrombolysis is contraindicated or fails.
- **Intermediate-High-Risk PE (Submassive PE)**: Patients who are hemodynamically stable but have RV dysfunction (on echo/CT) and elevated cardiac biomarkers. CDT may be considered to prevent clinical deterioration.

### Intervention Options (CDT)
- **Catheter-Directed Thrombolysis (CDT)**: Local delivery of a reduced dose of thrombolytic (e.g., tPA) directly into the pulmonary artery via catheter.
- **Pharmacomechanical Thrombectomy**: Combines local thrombolysis with mechanical clot disruption or aspiration.
- **Aspiration Thrombectomy**: Mechanical removal of clot without thrombolytic (e.g., FlowTriever, Indigo).

### Role of PERT
- **Pulmonary Embolism Response Team (PERT)**: A multidisciplinary team (IR, cardiology, pulmonary, critical care) is recommended for rapid risk stratification and coordinated decision-making for intermediate-high and high-risk PE.

### Post-procedural Care
- Continue systemic anticoagulation.
- Monitor for hemoptysis, access site bleeding, and hemodynamic changes.

### Contraindications
- Active internal bleeding, recent major surgery or trauma, intracranial pathology (hemorrhage, tumor, AVM), and severe uncontrolled hypertension are relative or absolute contraindications to thrombolysis.
