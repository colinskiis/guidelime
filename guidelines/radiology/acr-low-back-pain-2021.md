## Scope
Evidence-based imaging recommendations for evaluation of low back pain in adults, guiding appropriate use of radiography, CT, and MRI.

## Key Principles

### General Approach
- **Uncomplicated acute low back pain** (with or without radiculopathy) is benign and self-limited
- **Imaging NOT indicated** for acute low back pain without red flags
- Most patients improve within 4-6 weeks with conservative management

### Red Flags Warranting Early Imaging

#### Immediate Imaging Indicated
- **Cauda equina syndrome**: Saddle anesthesia, bladder/bowel dysfunction, bilateral leg weakness
- **Severe or progressive neurologic deficits**
- **Suspected malignancy**: History of cancer, unexplained weight loss, age >50 with new pain
- **Suspected infection**: Fever, IV drug use, immunocompromise, recent infection
- **Suspected fracture**: Trauma, osteoporosis, steroid use

## Imaging Recommendations by Clinical Scenario

### Acute Low Back Pain (<6 weeks)

#### Without Red Flags
| Modality | Appropriateness |
|----------|----------------|
| Imaging | **Usually NOT appropriate** |
| Recommendation | Conservative management, reassess in 4-6 weeks |

#### With Radiculopathy (No Red Flags)
| Modality | Appropriateness |
|----------|----------------|
| Imaging | **Usually NOT appropriate** initially |
| Recommendation | Conservative management first |

### Subacute/Chronic Low Back Pain (>6 weeks) - Failed Conservative Treatment

#### Without Radiculopathy
| Modality | Appropriateness |
|----------|----------------|
| X-ray lumbar spine | May be appropriate |
| MRI lumbar spine without contrast | May be appropriate |
| CT lumbar spine without contrast | May be appropriate |

#### With Radiculopathy
| Modality | Appropriateness |
|----------|----------------|
| MRI lumbar spine without contrast | **Usually appropriate** |
| CT lumbar spine without contrast | May be appropriate (if MRI contraindicated) |

### Suspected Cauda Equina Syndrome
| Modality | Appropriateness |
|----------|----------------|
| MRI lumbar spine without contrast | **Usually appropriate** (urgent) |
| CT lumbar spine without contrast | May be appropriate if MRI unavailable |

### Suspected Malignancy
| Modality | Appropriateness |
|----------|----------------|
| MRI lumbar spine without and with contrast | **Usually appropriate** |
| CT lumbar spine with contrast | May be appropriate |
| Bone scan | May be appropriate for metastatic survey |

### Suspected Infection
| Modality | Appropriateness |
|----------|----------------|
| MRI lumbar spine without and with contrast | **Usually appropriate** |
| CT lumbar spine with contrast | May be appropriate if MRI contraindicated |

### Suspected Vertebral Fracture
| Modality | Appropriateness |
|----------|----------------|
| X-ray lumbar spine | **Usually appropriate** (initial) |
| CT lumbar spine without contrast | Usually appropriate (if fracture suspected or confirmed) |
| MRI lumbar spine without contrast | Usually appropriate (for age, cord assessment) |

## Key Points for Ordering Clinicians
1. **Avoid routine imaging** for acute low back pain without red flags
2. Early imaging does not improve outcomes and may lead to unnecessary interventions
3. **MRI is preferred** over CT for radiculopathy evaluation (superior soft tissue visualization)
4. **Contrast** is typically needed only for suspected infection or malignancy
5. Patient education about benign nature of most low back pain is important
