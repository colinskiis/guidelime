## Scope
2024 ACR appropriateness criteria update on imaging for evaluation of acute chest pain when acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is suspected.

## Key Recommendations

### Initial Evaluation
- ECG + serial high-sensitivity troponins are foundational.
- Risk stratification using validated scores (HEART, TIMI) guides imaging decisions.

### Low-Risk Chest Pain (Negative ECG/Troponin, Low Clinical Probability)

#### Coronary CT Angiography (CCTA)
- **Usually Appropriate**: Excellent for ruling out obstructive CAD. High negative predictive value.
- May identify non-cardiac causes of chest pain.

#### Stress Testing
- **Usually Appropriate**: Exercise or pharmacologic stress with imaging (stress echo, myocardial perfusion imaging [MPI], stress CMR).
- Useful for functional assessment.

#### Coronary Artery Calcium (CAC) Score
- **May Be Appropriate**: Zero CAC score has high NPV for ACS in low-risk patients; does not rule out non-calcified plaque.

### Intermediate-Risk Chest Pain

#### CCTA
- **Usually Appropriate**: Allows anatomic assessment.

#### Stress Imaging (MPI, Stress Echo, Stress CMR)
- **Usually Appropriate**: For functional/ischemia assessment.

### High-Risk Chest Pain / Positive Troponin
- Proceed to invasive coronary angiography per ACS guidelines.
- Imaging is not for risk stratification but for intervention.

### Chest X-Ray
- Useful for ruling out non-cardiac causes (pneumonia, pneumothorax, aortic dissection suspicion → CT angiography).

### CT Angiography for Aortic Dissection
- If clinical suspicion for dissection (tearing pain, pulse deficit, wide mediastinum), CT aorta with contrast is usually appropriate.
