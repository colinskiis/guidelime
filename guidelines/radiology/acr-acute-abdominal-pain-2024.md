## Scope
2024 ACR appropriateness criteria update on imaging for acute nonlocalized abdominal pain in adults.

## Key Recommendations

### Initial Imaging

#### CT Abdomen and Pelvis with IV Contrast
- **Usually Appropriate**: First-line for most adults with acute nonlocalized abdominal pain.
- High sensitivity for common causes: appendicitis, diverticulitis, bowel obstruction, perforation, vascular emergencies.

#### CT Abdomen and Pelvis Without Contrast
- **Usually Appropriate**: Alternative when IV contrast is contraindicated (renal insufficiency, contrast allergy).
- Slightly reduced sensitivity for some conditions but still highly informative.

### Alternative Imaging

#### Abdominal X-Ray (Plain Film)
- **May Be Appropriate**: For suspected bowel obstruction or perforation (free air) as initial screening.
- Lower sensitivity than CT; often followed by CT.

#### Ultrasound
- **May Be Appropriate**: Preferred in pregnant women, children, and for specific conditions (biliary colic, cholecystitis, gynecologic causes).
- Operator-dependent; may be limited by body habitus or bowel gas.

#### MRI Abdomen and Pelvis
- **May Be Appropriate**: Alternative in pregnancy (no radiation) or for specific hepatobiliary/renal pathology.
- Limited availability for acute settings.

### Special Considerations

#### Pregnant Patients
- Ultrasound first-line.
- MRI (non-contrast) preferred over CT if further imaging needed.
- CT acceptable if MRI unavailable and clinical indication is urgent.

#### Renal Colic
- CT without contrast (low-dose protocol) is preferred for suspected ureteral stone.

#### RLQ Pain (Suspected Appendicitis)
- CT with contrast is highly accurate.
- Ultrasound may be used first in children, young women, or thin patients.
