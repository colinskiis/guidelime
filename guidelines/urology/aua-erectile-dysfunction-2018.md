# AUA Guideline: Erectile Dysfunction

## Scope
Evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of erectile dysfunction in adult men.

## Key Recommendations

### Definition
Erectile dysfunction (ED): Inability to achieve and/or maintain an erection sufficient for satisfactory sexual performance

### Initial Evaluation

#### History (Strong)
- Sexual history including onset, duration, severity
- Relationship factors
- Medical history (cardiovascular disease, diabetes, neurologic)
- Surgical history (pelvic, prostate)
- Medications (antihypertensives, antidepressants)
- Psychosocial factors
- Substance use (tobacco, alcohol)

#### Validated Questionnaires
- IIEF (International Index of Erectile Function)
- SHIM (Sexual Health Inventory for Men)
- Useful for severity assessment and treatment monitoring

#### Physical Examination
- Blood pressure
- Cardiovascular examination
- Genital examination (penis, testes)
- Secondary sexual characteristics
- Focused neurologic examination

#### Laboratory Testing (Conditional)
- Fasting glucose or HbA1c (screen for diabetes)
- Lipid profile
- Morning testosterone if low libido or clinical suspicion
- Additional testing based on findings

### First-Line Treatment

#### Lifestyle Modifications
- Weight loss if overweight
- Exercise
- Smoking cessation
- Limit alcohol
- Optimize control of diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia

#### PDE5 Inhibitors (Strong)
| Drug | Onset | Duration | Dosing |
|------|-------|----------|--------|
| Sildenafil | 30-60 min | 4-5 hours | 25-100 mg PRN |
| Tadalafil | 30 min-2 hrs | Up to 36 hours | 10-20 mg PRN or 2.5-5 mg daily |
| Vardenafil | 30-60 min | 4-5 hours | 5-20 mg PRN |
| Avanafil | 15-30 min | Up to 6 hours | 50-200 mg PRN |

#### PDE5 Inhibitor Counseling
- Take on empty stomach (except tadalafil)
- Sexual stimulation required
- May need 6-8 attempts before determining failure
- Common side effects: Headache, flushing, dyspepsia, rhinitis

#### Contraindications to PDE5 Inhibitors
- Nitrate therapy (absolute)
- Recent MI or unstable angina
- Hypotension
- Severe aortic stenosis
- Alpha-blocker use (caution, timing)

### Second-Line Treatment

#### Vacuum Erection Devices
- Non-invasive
- May be used with or instead of medications
- Constriction band to maintain erection
- Limit constriction time to <30 minutes

#### Intraurethral Alprostadil (MUSE)
- Prostaglandin E1
- 125-1000 mcg intraurethral
- Onset 5-10 minutes

#### Intracavernosal Injection Therapy
| Agent | Comments |
|-------|----------|
| Alprostadil | Most common single agent |
| Bi-mix | Papaverine + phentolamine |
| Tri-mix | Alprostadil + papaverine + phentolamine |

- Proper injection technique training essential
- Risk of priapism (seek care if >4 hours)
- Fibrosis with prolonged use

### Third-Line Treatment

#### Penile Prosthesis (Implant)
- Consider when conservative treatments fail
- Options: Malleable (semi-rigid) or inflatable
- High satisfaction rates
- Irreversible; destroys natural erectile tissue
- Risks: Infection, mechanical failure, erosion

### Special Populations

#### Post-Prostatectomy ED
- PDE5 inhibitors first-line
- Consider penile rehabilitation protocols
- May require higher doses
- Vacuum devices or injections if PDE5i fails

#### Diabetes
- More severe ED; less PDE5i response
- Optimize glycemic control
- May need combination therapy

#### Cardiovascular Disease
- ED may be early marker of CVD
- Sexual activity cardiac risk assessment
- Avoid nitrates with PDE5 inhibitors

### Psychosexual Therapy
- Consider for psychogenic ED
- May be used alone or with medical therapy
- Address performance anxiety, relationship issues

### Testosterone Therapy
- Only if documented hypogonadism
- May improve libido and erectile function
- Monitor prostate, hematocrit

### Low-Intensity Shockwave Therapy
- Emerging treatment
- Evidence limited
- Not recommended as standard treatment

### Referral Considerations
- Complex medical conditions
- Peyronie's disease
- Treatment failure
- Penile prosthesis consideration
