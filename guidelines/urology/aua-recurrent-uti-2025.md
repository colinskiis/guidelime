## Scope
Updated 2025 multisociety guideline for the diagnosis and management of recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections (rUTIs) in women.

## Key Recommendations

### Definition
- **Recurrent UTI (rUTI)**: ≥2 symptomatic UTIs in 6 months or ≥3 in 12 months.
- **Uncomplicated**: No structural or functional abnormalities of the urinary tract.

### Diagnosis
- Obtain a urine culture to confirm diagnosis with each symptomatic episode, when possible.
- Consider cystoscopy and/or upper tract imaging if there are atypical features (e.g., hematuria, treatment failures, concerns for anatomic abnormality or malignancy).

### Behavioral Modifications
- Encourage increased fluid intake.
- Void after intercourse (may be helpful).
- Avoid spermicides.

### Non-Antibiotic Prophylaxis
- **Vaginal Estrogen (Postmenopausal Women)**: Recommended to reduce rUTI frequency.
- **D-Mannose**: May be offered as an option. Evidence suggests potential benefit, though quality is limited.
- **Methenamine Hippurate**: May be considered as a non-antibiotic prophylactic option.
- **Cranberry Products**: May be offered, though evidence of benefit is modest and inconsistent.

### Antibiotic Prophylaxis
- May be offered when behavioral and non-antibiotic strategies have failed.
- **Options**:
  - Continuous low-dose prophylaxis (e.g., nitrofurantoin 50-100 mg daily, TMP-SMX 40/200 mg daily) for 3-6 months.
  - Post-coital prophylaxis if UTIs are temporally related to intercourse.
  - Patient-initiated self-treatment for select, reliable patients.

### Antibiotic Stewardship
- Use narrow-spectrum antibiotics when possible.
- Tailor antibiotic choice based on prior urine culture sensitivities.
