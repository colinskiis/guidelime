## Scope

This guideline provides recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in males.

## Key Recommendations

### Evaluation
- IPSS (AUA-SI) for symptom quantification
- Medical history and physical exam including DRE
- Urinalysis to exclude UTI/hematuria
- PSA testing with shared decision-making
- Post-void residual measurement
- Uroflowmetry for baseline assessment

### Watchful Waiting
- Appropriate for mild symptoms (IPSS ≤7)
- Lifestyle modifications: Fluid management, bladder training, reduce caffeine/alcohol
- Reassess annually

### Medical Therapy
**Alpha-Blockers (First-Line):**
- Tamsulosin, alfuzosin, silodosin
- Rapid symptom improvement
- Monitor for orthostatic hypotension

**5-Alpha Reductase Inhibitors:**
- Finasteride, dutasteride
- For enlarged prostate (>30-40g)
- Reduces progression and retention risk
- May take 6+ months for effect

**Combination Therapy:**
- Alpha-blocker + 5ARI for larger prostates
- Consider PDE5 inhibitor (tadalafil) for concurrent ED

**Anticholinergics/Beta-3 Agonists:**
- Add-on for storage symptoms
- Use with caution if elevated PVR

### Minimally Invasive Therapies
- Prostatic urethral lift (UroLift)
- Water vapor thermal therapy (Rezum)
- Transurethral microwave therapy
- Prostate artery embolization

### Surgical Treatment
- TURP remains gold standard
- Holmium laser enucleation (HoLEP) for larger prostates
- Greenlight laser (PVP)
- Simple prostatectomy for very large glands (>80-100g)
