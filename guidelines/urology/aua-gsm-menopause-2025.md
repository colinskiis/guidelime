## Scope
Comprehensive multi-society guideline addressing the identification, diagnosis, and evidence-based management of physiological and symptomatic changes in the urogenital tract associated with menopause.

## Key Recommendations

### Diagnosis
- **Clinical Diagnosis**: GSM is a clinical diagnosis based on symptoms (e.g., vaginal dryness, dyspareunia, urinary urgency, recurrent UTIs) and physical exam findings (e.g., pale/thin vaginal mucosa, loss of labial fullness, friability).
- **Proactive Screening**: Clinicians should proactively ask perimenopausal and postmenopausal patients about GSM symptoms, as many patients are hesitant to initiate the discussion.

### First-line (Non-hormonal)
- **Lubricants and Moisturizers**: Recommend regular use of vaginal moisturizers and short-acting lubricants for coital activity as first-line for mild symptoms.

### Pharmacological Management (Hormonal)
- **Low-Dose Vaginal Estrogen**: Preferred treatment for moderate-to-severe GSM. Available in creams, tablets, inserts, and rings. Minimal systemic absorption at these doses.
- **Intravaginal DHEA (Prasterone)**: Recommended as an effective alternative to vaginal estrogen for symptoms of dyspareunia.
- **Systemic Hormonal Therapy**: Beneficial for GSM if the patient is also being treated for vasomotor symptoms; however, low-dose vaginal estrogen may still be needed for localized urogenital relief.

### Oral Non-hormonal Pharmacotherapy
- **Ospemifene**: A Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulator (SERM) recommended for moderate-to-severe dyspareunia in patients who prefer oral therapy or have contraindications to vaginal hormone therapy.

### Urinary Considerations
- **Recurrent UTIs**: Vaginal estrogen is strongly recommended to reduce the risk of recurrent UTIs in postmenopausal patients.
- **Urinary Urgency/Frequency**: GSM treatment can significantly improve "overactive bladder" symptoms in postmenopausal patients.

### Special Populations (Breast Cancer)
- **Shared Decision-Making**: For patients with a history of estrogen-dependent breast cancer, first-line with non-hormonal lubricants/moisturizers. Low-dose vaginal hormone therapy may be considered in collaboration with the patient's oncologist for refractory symptoms.
