# AUA Guideline: Management of Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms Attributed to Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia

## Scope
Evidence-based recommendations for evaluation and management of male lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) attributed to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).

## Key Recommendations

### Initial Evaluation

#### Recommended Assessments
- Medical history including LUTS severity
- **IPSS (International Prostate Symptom Score)** or AUA-SI
- Physical exam including DRE
- Urinalysis
- PSA (if life expectancy >10 years and would change management)

#### Optional Assessments
- Uroflowmetry
- Post-void residual (PVR)
- Prostate imaging (ultrasound or MRI)

### Medical Management

#### Alpha-Blockers (First-Line)
- Tamsulosin, alfuzosin, silodosin, doxazosin, terazosin
- Reduce smooth muscle tone in prostate and bladder neck
- Rapid symptom improvement (days to weeks)

#### 5-Alpha Reductase Inhibitors (5-ARIs)
- Finasteride, dutasteride
- For enlarged prostates (>30-40g)
- Reduce prostate volume over months
- May be combined with alpha-blockers

#### Combination Therapy
- Alpha-blocker + 5-ARI for moderate-severe LUTS with enlarged prostate
- Alpha-blocker + anticholinergic for storage symptoms

#### Phosphodiesterase-5 Inhibitors (PDE5i)
- Tadalafil 5mg daily
- Modest LUTS improvement
- Useful if concurrent erectile dysfunction

#### Anticholinergics/Beta-3 Agonists
- For predominant storage symptoms (urgency, frequency)
- Monitor PVR; caution if high residual

### Minimally Invasive Surgical Therapies (MIST)

| Procedure | Mechanism | Considerations |
|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| Water vapor thermal therapy (Rezūm) | Ablates tissue with steam | Office-based option |
| Prostatic urethral lift (UroLift) | Mechanical compression | Preserves ejaculatory function |
| Aquablation | Robotic waterjet ablation | Larger prostates |

### Surgical Management

#### Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP)
- Gold standard for moderate prostates (30-80g)
- Effective symptom relief
- Risk: retrograde ejaculation

#### Laser Enucleation (HoLEP, ThuLEP)
- Effective for large prostates (>80g)
- Size-independent efficacy
- Steep learning curve

#### Photoselective Vaporization (PVP/Greenlight)
- Good for anticoagulated patients
- Less bleeding than TURP

#### Simple Prostatectomy
- For very large prostates (>80-100g)
- Open, laparoscopic, or robotic approach

### Treatment Selection Factors
- Symptom severity (IPSS score)
- Prostate size
- Patient goals (symptom relief vs preserving sexual function)
- Comorbidities and anticoagulation status
- Life expectancy

### When to Refer to Urology
- Failed medical therapy
- Recurrent urinary retention
- Recurrent UTIs
- Bladder stones
- Renal insufficiency due to BPH
- Gross hematuria
