## Scope
Comprehensive 2024 update providing evidence-based recommendations for the evaluation and management of the male partner in an infertile couple.

## Key Recommendations

### Initial Evaluation
- **History and Physical**: A thorough medical, sexual, and reproductive history should be obtained from all male partners of infertile couples.
- **Semen Analysis**: At least two properly collected semen analyses are recommended as the cornerstone of evaluation, referencing WHO 6th edition reference values.

### Hormonal Assessment
- **FSH and Testosterone**: Recommended if abnormal semen parameters are found (e.g., low sperm count, low volume).
- **Additional Hormones**: LH, prolactin, and estradiol may be considered in select cases.

### Genetic Testing
- **Karyotype**: Recommended for men with severe oligospermia (<5 million/mL) or non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA).
- **Y-Chromosome Microdeletion**: Recommended for men with NOA or severe oligospermia, as it has prognostic and counseling implications.
- **CFTR Mutation**: Strongly recommended for men with congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD).

### Varicocele
- **Treatment**: Varicocele repair (varicocelectomy) is recommended for palpable varicoceles in men with abnormal semen parameters and documented infertility when the female partner has normal fertility or a treatable infertility cause.

### Azoospermia
- **Classification**: Distinguish between obstructive (OA) and non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA) via history, exam, and hormone levels.
- **Sperm Retrieval**: For NOA, micro-dissection testicular sperm extraction (mTESE) is the preferred technique for sperm retrieval to be used with ICSI.
- **Hormonal Therapy**: Empirical hormonal therapy (e.g., clomiphene citrate, anastrozole, hCG/hMG) may improve spermatogenesis in select men with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.

### Lifestyle Modification
- Counseling on weight management, smoking cessation, moderation of alcohol, and avoidance of heat exposure (e.g., hot tubs) is recommended.
