## Scope
2024 AUA/SUFU guideline amendment on the diagnosis and treatment of overactive bladder (OAB) in adults.

## Key Recommendations

### Diagnosis
- **Clinical diagnosis** based on urinary urgency, with or without urge incontinence, usually with frequency and nocturia, in the absence of UTI or other obvious pathology.
- Urinalysis to exclude infection.
- Post-void residual if suspicion of incomplete emptying.
- Voiding diary helpful for assessment.

### First-Line Treatment (Behavioral Therapies)
- **Strongly Recommended**:
  - Bladder training, timed voiding.
  - Pelvic floor muscle training (Kegel exercises).
  - Fluid management.
  - Dietary modifications (limit caffeine, alcohol).
  - Weight loss if overweight.

### Second-Line Treatment (Pharmacotherapy)
- **Oral Options**:
  - **Beta-3 Agonists (Mirabegron, Vibegron)**: First-line pharmacotherapy consideration. Fewer anticholinergic side effects. Mirabegron may be combined with antimuscarinics.
  - **Antimuscarinics (Oxybutynin, Tolterodine, Solifenacin, Darifenacin, Fesoterodine, Trospium)**: Effective. Caution in elderly (cognitive effects, constipation, dry mouth). Avoid or use with extreme caution in patients with dementia.
- Extended-release formulations generally preferred for tolerability.

### Third-Line Treatment (Refractory OAB)
- **OnabotulinumtoxinA (Botox) Injection**: 100-200 units intradetrusor. Effective; risk of urinary retention.
- **Sacral Neuromodulation (SNM)**: Implanted device. Effective for refractory OAB.
- **Percutaneous Tibial Nerve Stimulation (PTNS)**: Weekly sessions; maintenance therapy needed.

### Special Populations
- **Elderly**: Prefer beta-3 agonists or low-dose extended-release antimuscarinics to minimize cognitive effects.
- **Frail Elderly with Dementia**: Antimuscarinics should be avoided.
