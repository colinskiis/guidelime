## Scope

This guideline provides recommendations for the diagnosis, staging, treatment, and surveillance of ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer.

## Key Recommendations

### Genetic Testing
- All patients: BRCA1/2, homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) testing
- Germline testing for inherited predisposition
- Somatic testing for treatment selection

### Staging and Surgery
- Primary cytoreductive surgery for most patients
- Goal: Complete gross resection (R0)
- Neoadjuvant chemotherapy for poor surgical candidates
- Interval debulking after 3-4 cycles

### First-Line Chemotherapy
- Carboplatin + paclitaxel (standard)
- IV vs. IP chemotherapy options
- Bevacizumab addition for high-risk disease
- Weekly paclitaxel acceptable alternative

### Maintenance Therapy
**BRCA-Mutated:**
- Olaparib maintenance post-first-line
- Significant PFS benefit

**HRD-Positive:**
- Olaparib + bevacizumab
- Niraparib option

**HRD-Negative:**
- Bevacizumab maintenance
- PARP inhibitors less effective but considered

### Recurrent Disease
- Platinum-sensitive: Re-treat with platinum-based regimen
- Platinum-resistant: Non-platinum agents (pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, gemcitabine, topotecan)
- Bevacizumab + chemotherapy
- PARP inhibitors for BRCA+ recurrence (if not previously used)

### Surveillance
- Physical exam, CA-125 every 2-4 months initially
- Imaging as clinically indicated
- Genetic counseling for hereditary syndromes
