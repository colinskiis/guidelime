## Scope
2024 ASCO/SGO guideline update on the first-line treatment of newly diagnosed advanced epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer.

## Key Recommendations

### Surgery
- **Primary Cytoreductive Surgery (PCS)**: Goal is complete gross resection (R0). Associated with improved survival.
- **Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy (NACT) + Interval Debulking Surgery (IDS)**: Consider for patients unlikely to achieve optimal cytoreduction with PCS or with high perioperative risk.

### Chemotherapy
- **Standard Regimen**: IV platinum + taxane (carboplatin AUC 5-6 + paclitaxel 175 mg/m² every 3 weeks x 6 cycles).
- **Dose-Dense Paclitaxel**: Weekly paclitaxel may be considered.
- **Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy**: Option for optimally debulked patients at experienced centers.

### Biomarker Testing (All Patients)
- **BRCA1/2 (Germline and Somatic)**: Essential for treatment decisions.
- **HRD (Homologous Recombination Deficiency) Status**: Guides PARP inhibitor eligibility.

### Maintenance Therapy

#### BRCA1/2 Mutated (Germline or Somatic)
- **PARP Inhibitor Maintenance (Olaparib, Niraparib, Rucaparib)**: Strongly recommended after response to platinum-based chemotherapy. Significant improvement in PFS.

#### HRD-Positive (Including BRCA)
- PARP inhibitor maintenance preferred.

#### HRD-Negative/Unknown
- **Bevacizumab**: May be used during and after chemotherapy.
- PARP inhibitor benefit less pronounced in HRD-negative populations.

### Bevacizumab
- Add bevacizumab to chemotherapy and continue as maintenance in patients at higher risk of progression (suboptimal debulking, stage IV).

### Second-Line and Beyond
- Addressed in separate guidelines.
