## Scope
Evidence-based recommendations for risk assessment, staging, and management of clinically localized prostate cancer.

## Key Recommendations

### Risk Stratification

#### Risk Groups
| Risk Group | Criteria |
|------------|----------|
| Very Low | T1c, Grade Group 1, PSA <10, <3 positive cores, ≤50% cancer/core, PSA density <0.15 |
| Low | T1-T2a, Grade Group 1, PSA <10 |
| Favorable Intermediate | T2b-T2c OR Grade Group 2 OR PSA 10-20 (1 factor only, <50% positive cores) |
| Unfavorable Intermediate | T2b-T2c OR Grade Group 2 OR PSA 10-20 (>1 factor OR ≥50% positive cores OR Grade Group 3) |
| High | T3a OR Grade Group 4-5 OR PSA >20 |
| Very High | T3b-T4 OR Primary Gleason pattern 5 OR >4 cores Grade Group 4-5 |

### Staging Workup

#### Imaging
| Risk Group | Imaging Recommendations |
|------------|------------------------|
| Low/Very Low | Generally not needed |
| Intermediate | Consider PSMA PET or conventional imaging |
| High/Very High | PSMA PET preferred OR CT/MRI + bone scan |

#### MRI
- Consider mpMRI for risk stratification
- Helpful for local staging
- May guide biopsy

### Active Surveillance

#### Ideal Candidates
- Very low and low risk
- Select favorable intermediate risk
- Life expectancy ≥10 years

#### Monitoring Protocol
| Test | Frequency |
|------|-----------|
| PSA | Every 6 months |
| DRE | Every 12 months |
| Repeat biopsy | Within 12-24 months, then periodically |
| mpMRI | Consider for monitoring |

#### Triggers for Treatment
- Grade progression (Grade Group ≥2)
- Significant volume increase
- Clinical progression
- Patient preference

### Radical Prostatectomy

#### Indications
- Localized prostate cancer with life expectancy ≥10 years
- Consider for any risk group if surgically appropriate

#### Surgical Approach
- Open, laparoscopic, or robotic-assisted
- No clear superiority of one approach
- Experience matters

#### Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection
| Risk | Recommendation |
|------|----------------|
| Low | Not recommended |
| Intermediate | Consider if predicted LN+ ≥2% |
| High/Very High | Recommended (extended template) |

#### Nerve Sparing
- Consider when oncologically appropriate
- Preserves erectile function
- Based on tumor location and extent

### Radiation Therapy

#### External Beam Radiation
| Technique | Notes |
|-----------|-------|
| IMRT | Standard |
| SBRT | 5 fractions, selected patients |
| Conventional fractionation | 39-45 fractions |
| Moderate hypofractionation | 20-28 fractions |

#### Brachytherapy
| Type | Indication |
|------|------------|
| Low-dose rate (LDR) | Low/intermediate risk |
| High-dose rate (HDR) | Often combined with EBRT |
| Monotherapy | Low/favorable intermediate |

#### Androgen Deprivation Therapy with Radiation
| Risk Group | ADT Duration |
|------------|--------------|
| Low | Not recommended |
| Favorable Intermediate | None or short-term (4-6 months) |
| Unfavorable Intermediate | Short-term (4-6 months) |
| High/Very High | Long-term (18-36 months) |

### Post-Treatment Monitoring

#### After Prostatectomy
| Parameter | Recommendation |
|-----------|----------------|
| PSA | Every 6-12 months |
| Undetectable | <0.1 ng/mL |
| Biochemical recurrence | PSA ≥0.2 ng/mL |

#### After Radiation
| Parameter | Recommendation |
|-----------|----------------|
| PSA | Every 6 months x 5 years, then annually |
| Nadir | Variable; usually <1 ng/mL |
| Biochemical recurrence | Nadir + 2 ng/mL |

### Salvage Therapy

#### After Prostatectomy
- Salvage radiation (early, at low PSA)
- +/- ADT depending on risk features

#### After Radiation
- Salvage prostatectomy (selected patients)
- Focal therapy options
- Salvage cryotherapy
- Salvage HIFU

### Special Considerations

#### Watchful Waiting
- Observation without curative intent
- For limited life expectancy
- Symptomatic treatment if progression

#### Focal Therapy
- Emerging approach
- Selected patients
- Long-term data limited

### Shared Decision-Making
- Discuss all appropriate options
- Consider patient values and preferences
- Quality of life considerations
- Involve patient in decision
