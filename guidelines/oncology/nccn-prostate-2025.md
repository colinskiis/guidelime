## Scope

This guideline provides comprehensive recommendations for the screening, diagnosis, staging, risk stratification, and treatment of prostate cancer.

## Key Recommendations

### Screening
- Shared decision-making starting age 50-55 (earlier for high-risk)
- PSA testing; digital rectal exam
- MRI-guided/fusion biopsy for elevated PSA

### Risk Stratification
**Very Low/Low Risk:**
- Active surveillance preferred
- Localized treatment for select patients with >10-year life expectancy

**Intermediate Risk:**
- Radiation + short-term ADT OR radical prostatectomy
- Active surveillance for select favorable intermediate

**High/Very High Risk:**
- Radiation + long-term ADT (2-3 years)
- Radical prostatectomy + adjuvant/salvage radiation for adverse pathology
- PSMA PET-CT for staging

### Locally Advanced/Node Positive (N+)
- Definitive radiation + ADT + abiraterone
- Consider intensification with apalutamide or darolutamide

### Metastatic Hormone-Sensitive (mHSPC)
**Doublet Therapy:**
- ADT + novel hormonal agent (abiraterone, apalutamide, enzalutamide, darolutamide)

**Triplet Therapy (High-Volume mHSPC):**
- ADT + docetaxel + novel hormonal agent

### Metastatic Castration-Resistant (mCRPC)
**Treatment Options:**
- Abiraterone, enzalutamide (if not prior)
- Docetaxel or cabazitaxel
- PARP inhibitor (if HRR mutation)
- Lutetium-177 PSMA therapy (PSMA-positive)
- Radium-223 for bone-predominant disease
- Pembrolizumab for MSI-H/dMMR

### Genetic Testing
- Germline testing for all metastatic and high-risk localized
- Somatic tumor testing for mCRPC
- BRCA1/2, ATM, HRR genes for PARP eligibility

### Surveillance
- PSA monitoring post-treatment
- Imaging for biochemical recurrence
