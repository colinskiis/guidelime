## Scope
Evidence-based recommendations for systemic treatment of metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma, including first-line therapy, molecular testing, and subsequent lines of treatment.

## Key Recommendations

### Molecular Testing

#### Required Testing (Strong)
| Test | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Germline BRCA1/2 | PARP inhibitor eligibility |
| Somatic BRCA1/2 | PARP inhibitor eligibility |
| MSI-H/dMMR | Pembrolizumab eligibility |
| NTRK fusions | TRK inhibitor eligibility |

#### Testing Recommendations
- Offer testing to ALL patients with metastatic disease
- Germline testing has implications for family members
- Somatic testing via tumor tissue or liquid biopsy

### First-Line Treatment

#### Good Performance Status (ECOG 0-1)
| Regimen | Components | Notes |
|---------|------------|-------|
| FOLFIRINOX | 5-FU, leucovorin, irinotecan, oxaliplatin | Preferred if tolerable |
| Modified FOLFIRINOX | Reduced doses | More tolerable |
| Gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel | | Alternative first-line |

#### Moderate Performance Status (ECOG 2)
| Regimen | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| Gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel | Preferred |
| Gemcitabine monotherapy | If borderline PS |

#### Poor Performance Status (ECOG 3-4)
- Best supportive care
- Gemcitabine monotherapy if patient desires treatment
- Clinical trial if available

### BRCA-Mutated Pancreatic Cancer

#### First-Line
- Platinum-containing regimen (FOLFIRINOX preferred)
- Gemcitabine + cisplatin alternative

#### Maintenance Therapy
- **Olaparib** for patients with germline BRCA1/2 mutation
- After ≥16 weeks of platinum-based therapy without progression
- Continue until progression or unacceptable toxicity

### MSI-H/dMMR Pancreatic Cancer

#### Second-Line and Beyond
- **Pembrolizumab** 200 mg IV every 3 weeks
- Rare in pancreatic cancer (~1-2%)
- Test all patients

### NTRK Fusion-Positive

#### Any Line
- Larotrectinib or entrectinib
- Very rare in pancreatic cancer
- Tumor-agnostic approval

### Second-Line Treatment

#### After FOLFIRINOX
| Regimen | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| Gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel | Standard |
| Gemcitabine monotherapy | If poor PS |

#### After Gemcitabine-Based
| Regimen | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| 5-FU + liposomal irinotecan (nal-IRI) | NAPOLI-1 regimen |
| FOLFOX | Alternative |
| Clinical trial | Encouraged |

### Liposomal Irinotecan (nal-IRI)
- Combined with 5-FU/leucovorin
- After gemcitabine-based therapy
- Improved OS vs 5-FU alone

### Third-Line and Beyond
- Consider clinical trials
- Best supportive care
- NTRK inhibitors if fusion-positive
- Pembrolizumab if MSI-H (if not given earlier)

### Supportive Care

#### Pain Management
- Celiac plexus block for abdominal pain
- Opioids as needed
- Palliative radiation for local symptoms

#### Nutritional Support
- Pancreatic enzyme replacement
- Dietitian involvement
- Address weight loss

#### Biliary Obstruction
- Endoscopic stenting preferred
- Percutaneous if endoscopic fails

#### Venous Thromboembolism
- High risk in pancreatic cancer
- Prophylaxis with LMWH or DOAC
- Treatment dose if VTE occurs

### Monitoring
- CT scans every 2-3 months
- CA 19-9 monitoring (if elevated at baseline)
- Clinical assessment

### Palliative Care
- Early integration recommended
- Improves quality of life
- May improve survival

### Clinical Trials
- Encourage participation at all stages
- Many ongoing trials for pancreatic cancer
- Novel agents and combinations
