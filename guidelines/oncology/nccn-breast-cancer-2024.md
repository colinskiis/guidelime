# NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology: Breast Cancer

## Scope
Comprehensive recommendations for the clinical management of breast cancer, including carcinoma in situ, invasive breast cancer, inflammatory breast cancer, and special situations.

## Key Recommendations

### Workup and Staging

#### Initial Workup
- Complete history and physical examination
- Bilateral diagnostic mammography
- Breast ultrasound as needed
- Breast MRI (selective use)
- Core needle biopsy with receptor testing

#### Pathology Essentials
| Test | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| ER/PR status | Hormonal therapy eligibility |
| HER2 status | HER2-targeted therapy eligibility |
| Ki-67 | Proliferation marker |
| Tumor grade | Prognosis |
| Gene expression assays | Risk stratification (if indicated) |

#### Gene Expression Assays
- Oncotype DX (21-gene)
- MammaPrint (70-gene)
- PAM50/Prosigna
- EndoPredict
- Breast Cancer Index

### Ductal Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS)

#### Treatment
- Lumpectomy + radiation (preferred)
- Mastectomy for extensive disease or patient preference
- Consider endocrine therapy for risk reduction

#### Endocrine Therapy for DCIS
- Tamoxifen 20 mg daily × 5 years (premenopausal)
- Tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitor (postmenopausal)

### Early-Stage Invasive Breast Cancer

#### Surgical Options
- Breast-conserving surgery (lumpectomy) + radiation
- Mastectomy ± reconstruction
- Sentinel lymph node biopsy

#### Adjuvant Radiation
- After lumpectomy: Whole breast ± boost
- After mastectomy: Consider for high-risk features
- Nodal radiation for positive nodes

### Systemic Therapy by Subtype

#### HR+/HER2- (Luminal)
**Premenopausal:**
- Tamoxifen ± ovarian suppression
- Consider adding CDK4/6 inhibitor for high-risk

**Postmenopausal:**
- Aromatase inhibitor (anastrozole, letrozole, exemestane)
- Extended therapy (7-10 years) for high risk
- Abemaciclib for high-risk (Ki-67 ≥20%, node positive, grade 3)

**Chemotherapy (if indicated):**
- Dose-dense AC-T (doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide → paclitaxel)
- TC (docetaxel/cyclophosphamide)
- Use gene expression assays to guide decision

#### HER2+ Breast Cancer
**Neoadjuvant:**
- Trastuzumab + pertuzumab + chemotherapy

**Adjuvant:**
- Trastuzumab × 1 year (standard)
- Trastuzumab + pertuzumab for high risk
- T-DM1 if residual disease after neoadjuvant therapy

#### Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC)
**Neoadjuvant:**
- Pembrolizumab + chemotherapy (for Stage II-III)
- Assess response at surgery

**Adjuvant:**
- Continue pembrolizumab if used neoadjuvantly
- Capecitabine if residual disease after neoadjuvant
- Olaparib if BRCA1/2 mutation

### Metastatic Breast Cancer

#### HR+/HER2- Metastatic
**First-line:**
- CDK4/6 inhibitor + aromatase inhibitor or fulvestrant
- Options: Palbociclib, ribociclib, abemaciclib

**Second-line and beyond:**
- Fulvestrant ± alpelisib (if PIK3CA mutation)
- Elacestrant (if ESR1 mutation)
- mTOR inhibitors (everolimus)
- Chemotherapy

#### HER2+ Metastatic
**First-line:**
- Trastuzumab + pertuzumab + taxane

**Second-line:**
- Trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd)

**Third-line:**
- Tucatinib + trastuzumab + capecitabine
- Other HER2-targeted agents

#### Triple-Negative Metastatic
**PD-L1 positive:**
- Pembrolizumab + chemotherapy

**BRCA-mutated:**
- PARP inhibitor (olaparib, talazoparib)

**Other options:**
- Sacituzumab govitecan
- Chemotherapy

### Special Populations

#### Genetic Testing
- BRCA1/2 mutation testing for high-risk patients
- Consider multigene panel testing
- Affects surgical decisions and systemic therapy

#### Pregnancy-Associated Breast Cancer
- Multidisciplinary planning
- Chemotherapy feasible in 2nd/3rd trimester
- Avoid radiation during pregnancy
- Trastuzumab contraindicated during pregnancy

### Surveillance After Treatment
- History and physical every 3-6 months × 3 years, then annually
- Annual mammography
- Bone health monitoring if on aromatase inhibitor
- No routine imaging for metastases (asymptomatic patients)
