## Scope
2024 ESMO clinical practice guideline update on the diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of gastric and gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma.

## Key Recommendations

### Diagnosis and Staging
- EGD with multiple biopsies.
- CT chest/abdomen/pelvis for staging.
- EUS for locoregional staging (T and N stage).
- PET-CT may be used in select cases.
- Staging laparoscopy for locally advanced disease to rule out peritoneal metastases before curative-intent treatment.

### Biomarker Testing
- **HER2**: Test all advanced/metastatic cases. HER2-positive tumors receive trastuzumab.
- **PD-L1 (CPS)**: Test for metastatic disease to guide immunotherapy.
- **MSI/dMMR**: Can predict response to immunotherapy.
- **Claudin-18.2**: Emerging biomarker for targeted therapy.

### Localized/Resectable Disease
- **Surgery**: Gastrectomy (total or subtotal) with D2 lymphadenectomy is standard for resectable gastric cancer.
- **Perioperative Chemotherapy**: FLOT (5-FU, leucovorin, oxaliplatin, docetaxel) regimen is preferred. 4 cycles pre-op + 4 cycles post-op.
- For MSI-H tumors, neoadjuvant immunotherapy is under investigation.

### Advanced/Metastatic Disease

#### First-Line
- Doublet chemotherapy (fluoropyrimidine + platinum) + anti-PD-1 (nivolumab or pembrolizumab) for PD-L1 CPS ≥5 (or ≥1 depending on agent).
- Add trastuzumab if HER2-positive.

#### Second-Line
- Ramucirumab + paclitaxel is a standard option.
- Trifluridine/tipiracil for later lines.

### Supportive Care
- Nutritional support, pain management, psychological support.
