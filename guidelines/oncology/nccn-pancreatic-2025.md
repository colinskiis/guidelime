## Scope

This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis, staging, treatment, and surveillance of patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

## Key Recommendations

### Diagnosis and Staging
- Multiphase CT of chest/abdomen/pelvis preferred for staging
- EUS-guided FNA for tissue diagnosis
- CA 19-9: Baseline and monitoring marker
- Molecular profiling: KRAS, BRCA1/2, MSI-H, NTRK testing

### Resectable Disease
- Surgical resection: Only potentially curative option
- Pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple) for head lesions
- Distal pancreatectomy for body/tail lesions
- Neoadjuvant therapy increasingly considered
- Adjuvant chemotherapy: Modified FOLFIRINOX or gemcitabine/capecitabine

### Borderline Resectable
- Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with or without radiation
- Reassess for resectability after treatment
- Consider chemoradiation if stable/responding

### Locally Advanced Unresectable
- FOLFIRINOX or gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel
- Radiation may be considered for local control
- Clinical trial enrollment encouraged

### Metastatic Disease
- First-line: FOLFIRINOX or gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel based on PS
- BRCA mutated: Platinum-based therapy; PARP inhibitor maintenance
- MSI-H: Pembrolizumab
- NTRK fusion positive: Larotrectinib or entrectinib

### Supportive Care
- Pain management: Celiac plexus block effective
- Pancreatic enzyme supplementation
- Nutritional support and diabetes management
- Early palliative care integration
