# ASCO Guideline Update: Systemic Therapy for Melanoma

## Scope
Evidence-based recommendations for systemic therapy in cutaneous melanoma, including neoadjuvant, adjuvant, and treatment of unresectable/metastatic disease.

## Key Recommendations

### Neoadjuvant Therapy

#### Resectable Stage IIIB-IV (New Recommendation)
- **Neoadjuvant pembrolizumab** recommended
- 3 cycles before surgery, then adjuvant therapy
- Improves event-free survival

### Adjuvant Therapy

#### Stage IIB-IIC
- **Pembrolizumab** or **Nivolumab** (New)
- Consider after wide local excision and SLNB
- Discuss risk-benefit with patient

#### Stage III (Resected)
| Agent | Duration | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Nivolumab | 1 year | Preferred |
| Pembrolizumab | 1 year | Preferred |
| Dabrafenib + trametinib | 1 year | If BRAF V600E/K mutant |

#### Stage IV (Completely Resected)
- Nivolumab OR
- Pembrolizumab OR
- Nivolumab + ipilimumab (consider for higher risk)

### Unresectable/Metastatic Melanoma

#### First-Line Therapy

##### BRAF Wild-Type
| Regimen | Recommendation |
|---------|----------------|
| Nivolumab + ipilimumab | Preferred |
| Pembrolizumab | Alternative |
| Nivolumab | Alternative |
| Nivolumab + relatlimab | Alternative (New) |

##### BRAF V600E/K Mutant
| Regimen | Recommendation |
|---------|----------------|
| Nivolumab + ipilimumab → nivolumab | Preferred over BRAF/MEK |
| Pembrolizumab | Alternative |
| Nivolumab | Alternative |
| Dabrafenib + trametinib | If immunotherapy not suitable |
| Vemurafenib + cobimetinib | If immunotherapy not suitable |
| Encorafenib + binimetinib | If immunotherapy not suitable |

#### Second-Line and Beyond
- Switch class (immunotherapy ↔ targeted therapy)
- Clinical trial
- Ipilimumab monotherapy (if not received)
- Other immunotherapy combinations

### LAG-3 Inhibitor

#### Relatlimab + Nivolumab (New)
- FDA approved for unresectable/metastatic melanoma
- May be considered first-line
- Particularly for PD-L1 negative tumors

### Brain Metastases

#### Active Brain Metastases
| Approach | Options |
|----------|---------|
| Asymptomatic, small | Nivolumab + ipilimumab may defer radiation |
| Symptomatic or large | SRS or surgery, then systemic therapy |

#### Management
- Multidisciplinary discussion
- Consider intracranial activity of systemic agents
- Steroids if needed (may affect immunotherapy efficacy)

### Treatment Sequencing

#### BRAF Mutant Disease
- Immunotherapy preferred first-line over targeted therapy
- Targeted therapy reserved for:
  - Rapid progression needed
  - Immunotherapy contraindication
  - After immunotherapy failure

### Duration of Therapy

#### Checkpoint Inhibitors
- Continue until progression or unacceptable toxicity
- Consider stopping after 2 years of complete response
- Rechallenge may be effective

#### BRAF/MEK Inhibitors
- Continue until progression or toxicity

### Monitoring

#### During Treatment
- Clinical assessment
- Imaging every 3-4 months
- LDH monitoring
- Toxicity assessment

#### After Treatment
- Surveillance imaging
- Monitor for recurrence
- Long-term toxicity assessment

### Immune-Related Adverse Events

#### Management
- Early recognition
- Corticosteroids for moderate-severe
- Specialist referral as needed
- Hold or discontinue immunotherapy based on severity

### Special Populations

#### Autoimmune Disease
- Discuss risks with patient
- Consider single-agent anti-PD-1 over combination

#### Organ Transplant
- High risk of rejection with checkpoint inhibitors
- Discuss with transplant team
