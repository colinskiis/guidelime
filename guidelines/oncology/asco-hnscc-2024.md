## Scope
2024 ASCO guideline update on the definitive treatment of locally advanced (stage III-IVB) head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).

## Key Recommendations

### HPV Status
- Determine p16/HPV status for oropharyngeal cancer (prognostic and may influence treatment in clinical trials).

### Definitive Chemoradiation (Non-Surgical Approach)

#### Standard of Care
- **High-Dose Cisplatin (100 mg/m² every 3 weeks x 3 cycles) + Concurrent Radiation**: Preferred for fit patients.
- **Weekly Cisplatin (40 mg/m²)**: Alternative; similar efficacy with different toxicity profile.

#### Cisplatin-Ineligible Patients
- **Cetuximab + Radiation**: For patients unable to receive cisplatin (renal impairment, hearing loss, poor performance status).
- Note: Cisplatin-based regimens provide better outcomes when tolerable.

### Larynx Preservation
- Induction chemotherapy (TPF: docetaxel, cisplatin, 5-FU) followed by chemoradiation OR concurrent chemoradiation for larynx/hypopharynx cancer as alternative to total laryngectomy.

### Adjuvant Therapy (Post-Surgical)
- **Positive Margins or Extranodal Extension**: Concurrent cisplatin + radiation improves outcomes.
- **High-Risk Features Without ENE/Margins**: Radiation alone may be appropriate.

### Immunotherapy Integration
- **Pembrolizumab or Nivolumab**: Not yet standard in definitive locally advanced setting; reserved for recurrent/metastatic disease.
- Ongoing trials evaluating immunotherapy in definitive treatment.

### Supportive Care
- Nutrition support (PEG tube if needed).
- Speech/swallowing therapy.
- Management of mucositis, xerostomia.
- Smoking cessation.
