## Scope
Recommendations for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening in average-risk adults, including age to begin screening, screening modalities, and intervals.

## Key Recommendations

### Age to Begin Screening

#### Strong Recommendation
- Adults at **average risk should begin CRC screening at age 45**
- This is a qualified strong recommendation

#### Previous vs. Current Recommendation
| Previous (2008) | Current (2018) |
|-----------------|----------------|
| Begin at age 50 | Begin at age 45 |

#### Rationale for Earlier Screening
- Rising incidence of CRC in adults <50
- Modeling studies support benefit starting at 45
- Favorable balance of benefits and harms

### Age to Stop Screening

#### Recommendation
- Continue screening through **age 75** for those in good health
- Ages **76-85**: Individualized decision based on health status
- **Age 85+**: No longer recommended

### Screening Options

#### Stool-Based Tests
| Test | Interval | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| FIT (fecal immunochemical test) | Annual | Preferred stool test |
| gFOBT (high-sensitivity) | Annual | Less preferred than FIT |
| Multi-target stool DNA (mt-sDNA) | Every 3 years | Cologuard; higher sensitivity, lower specificity |

#### Visual (Structural) Examinations
| Test | Interval | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| Colonoscopy | Every 10 years | Gold standard; allows polypectomy |
| CT colonography | Every 5 years | Requires bowel prep |
| Flexible sigmoidoscopy | Every 5 years | Only visualizes left colon |

### Comparison of Modalities

#### Advantages and Limitations
| Test | Advantage | Limitation |
|------|-----------|------------|
| Colonoscopy | Full colon visualization, therapeutic | Requires sedation, bowel prep |
| FIT | Non-invasive, no prep | Requires annual testing, colonoscopy if positive |
| mt-sDNA | Higher sensitivity than FIT | Every 3 years, more false positives |
| CT colonography | Non-invasive visualization | Radiation, requires prep, follow-up colonoscopy if positive |

### Risk Categories

#### Average Risk (This Guideline)
- No personal history of CRC or adenomatous polyps
- No inflammatory bowel disease
- No confirmed or suspected hereditary CRC syndrome
- No significant family history (first-degree relative with CRC)

#### Higher Risk (Separate Recommendations)
- Personal history of CRC or adenomas
- Family history of CRC (first-degree relative)
- Hereditary syndromes (Lynch, FAP)
- IBD (Crohn's, ulcerative colitis)
- History of abdominal/pelvic radiation

### Post-Polypectomy Surveillance
- Not covered in this guideline
- Follow gastroenterology surveillance recommendations based on polyp findings

### Positive Stool Test Follow-Up
- **Any positive stool test requires colonoscopy**
- Do not repeat stool test or substitute with another modality
- Colonoscopy should be performed promptly

### Quality Considerations

#### Colonoscopy Quality Metrics
- Adenoma detection rate (target ≥25%)
- Cecal intubation rate (≥95%)
- Adequate bowel preparation
- Appropriate withdrawal time

### Shared Decision-Making
- Discuss benefits and limitations of each modality
- Patient preferences matter
- Best test is one that gets done

### Implementation Considerations
- Increase access to screening
- Address barriers (cost, transportation, time)
- Ensure follow-up of abnormal results
- Track screening completion

### Key Points for Clinicians
1. Start screening at 45 for average-risk adults
2. Offer choice of modalities
3. FIT annually or colonoscopy every 10 years are effective options
4. All positive non-colonoscopy tests require colonoscopy
5. Continue through age 75; individualize for 76-85
