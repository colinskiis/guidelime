# ASCO Living Guideline: Stage IV NSCLC with Driver Alterations (Version 2025.1)

## Scope

Updates recommendations for systemic therapy in patients with Stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have specific driver alterations (e.g., EGFR, ALK, ROS1, BRAF, MET, RET).

## Key Recommendations

### EGFR Mutations
- **First-line**: Osimertinib remains the preferred first-line therapy for sensitizing EGFR mutations (Exon 19 del/L858R).
- **Update**: Amivantamab plus lazertinib or chemotherapy may be considered in specific settings after progression.

### ALK Rearrangements
- **First-line**: Next-generation ALK inhibitors (alectinib, brigatinib, or lorlatinib) are preferred.

### Other Alterations
- Specific recommendations for ROS1, BRAF V600E, MET exon 14 skipping, and RET fusions are updated to reflect newer clinical trial data.

## Notes

This "living guideline" is updated frequently as soon as significant new evidence impacts clinical practice recommendations.
