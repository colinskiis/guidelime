# NCCN Guidelines for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer

## Scope
Recommendations for diagnosis, primary treatment, surveillance, and subsequent treatment of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

## Key Recommendations

### Biomarker Testing
- **Broad molecular profiling (Category 1)**: Strongly recommended for all patients with advanced/metastatic NSCLC
- Test for all actionable molecular biomarkers specified in guidelines
- **PD-L1 expression testing (Category 1)**: Upfront testing before first-line therapy regardless of histology

### Actionable Molecular Biomarkers
Testing should include:
- EGFR mutations
- ALK rearrangements
- ROS1 rearrangements
- BRAF V600E mutations
- NTRK fusions
- MET exon 14 skipping mutations
- RET rearrangements
- KRAS G12C mutations
- HER2 mutations

### Treatment by Stage

#### Early Stage (I-II)
- Surgical resection preferred for operable patients
- Consider stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) for inoperable patients
- Adjuvant systemic therapy based on pathologic staging and biomarkers

#### Locally Advanced (Stage III)
- Concurrent chemoradiation for unresectable disease
- Consider consolidation immunotherapy with durvalumab

#### Metastatic (Stage IV)
- Treatment selection based on molecular testing results
- Targeted therapy for actionable driver mutations
- Immunotherapy-based regimens for PD-L1+ tumors without drivers
- Combination chemotherapy + immunotherapy for appropriate patients

### Targeted Therapies
Approved agents for specific alterations:
- **EGFR**: Osimertinib (preferred), erlotinib, gefitinib, afatinib
- **ALK**: Alectinib, brigatinib, lorlatinib
- **ROS1**: Crizotinib, entrectinib, repotrectinib
- **BRAF V600E**: Dabrafenib + trametinib
- **MET exon 14**: Capmatinib, tepotinib
- **RET**: Selpercatinib, pralsetinib
- **KRAS G12C**: Sotorasib, adagrasib

### Immunotherapy
- Pembrolizumab, nivolumab, atezolizumab, durvalumab
- Selection based on PD-L1 expression and clinical context

## Survival Data
- 2-year relative survival improved from 34% (2009-2010) to 42% (2015-2016)
- 5-year survival rates: 15-62.5% depending on biomarker status and treatment
