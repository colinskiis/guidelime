## Scope
Comprehensive guidelines for diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of early breast cancer.

## Key Recommendations

### Multidisciplinary Care

#### Team Composition
| Specialty | Role |
|-----------|------|
| Breast surgeon | Surgery planning and execution |
| Medical oncologist | Systemic therapy |
| Radiation oncologist | Radiotherapy planning |
| Pathologist | Diagnosis and biomarker assessment |
| Radiologist | Imaging interpretation |
| Breast care nurse | Patient support and coordination |
| Geneticist | Hereditary risk assessment |
| Plastic surgeon | Reconstruction consultation |

### Diagnosis and Staging

#### Initial Workup
| Component | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Clinical examination | Breast and axilla |
| Mammography | Bilateral |
| Ultrasound | Breast and axilla |
| MRI | Selected cases |
| Core needle biopsy | Histological confirmation |

#### Pathology Requirements
| Element | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Histological type | Invasive vs in situ |
| Grade | Nottingham grading |
| ER/PR status | Immunohistochemistry |
| HER2 status | IHC and/or ISH |
| Ki-67 | Proliferation marker |
| Tumor size | Pathological measurement |
| Nodal status | Number of positive nodes |

### Staging Workup

#### When to Stage for Metastases
| Recommendation | Details |
|----------------|---------|
| Stage IIb and higher | Recommend staging |
| High risk of recurrence | Consider staging |
| Extended nodal involvement | Staging indicated |
| Symptomatic patients | Staging indicated |
| Low-risk early disease | Staging not routinely needed |

### Genomic Assays

#### Role in Decision-Making
| Assay | Use |
|-------|-----|
| Oncotype DX | ER+, HER2-, node-negative/limited |
| MammaPrint | Risk stratification |
| EndoPredict | ER+, HER2- |
| PAM50/Prosigna | Intrinsic subtyping |

#### When to Use
- Uncertainty about chemotherapy benefit
- ER+, HER2-negative disease
- Node-negative or limited nodal involvement
- Inform adjuvant treatment decisions

### Surgery

#### Breast Surgery
| Approach | Indication |
|----------|------------|
| Breast-conserving surgery | When feasible with clear margins |
| Mastectomy | Patient choice or not BCS candidate |
| Margins | No tumor on ink for invasive |
| Oncoplastic techniques | Consider for larger resections |

#### Axillary Surgery
| Approach | Indication |
|----------|------------|
| Sentinel node biopsy | Clinically node-negative |
| Axillary dissection | Positive sentinel nodes (varies by scenario) |
| Omission of ALND | Limited nodal disease with BCS + RT |

#### Reconstruction
| Timing | Options |
|--------|---------|
| Immediate | At time of mastectomy |
| Delayed | After completing treatment |
| Techniques | Implant, autologous tissue |

### Systemic Therapy

#### Chemotherapy Indications
| Subtype | Recommendation |
|---------|----------------|
| Triple-negative | Chemotherapy recommended |
| HER2-positive | Chemotherapy + HER2-targeted therapy |
| ER+/HER2- high risk | Consider based on genomic assay |
| ER+/HER2- low risk | Endocrine therapy alone |

#### Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy
| Indication | Details |
|------------|---------|
| Locally advanced | To enable surgery |
| Inflammatory | Standard approach |
| Borderline resectable | Downstage to BCS |
| Triple-negative | Higher pCR rates |
| HER2-positive | Standard with trastuzumab ± pertuzumab |

#### Adjuvant Endocrine Therapy
| Agent | Duration |
|-------|----------|
| Tamoxifen (premenopausal) | 5-10 years |
| Aromatase inhibitor (postmenopausal) | 5 years |
| Extended therapy | Consider for high-risk |
| Ovarian suppression | Add for high-risk premenopausal |

#### HER2-Targeted Therapy
| Agent | Setting |
|-------|---------|
| Trastuzumab | Standard adjuvant, 1 year |
| Pertuzumab | High-risk adjuvant |
| T-DM1 | Residual disease after neoadjuvant |
| Neratinib | Extended adjuvant, high-risk |

#### CDK4/6 Inhibitors
| Agent | Indication |
|-------|------------|
| Abemaciclib | High-risk ER+/HER2-, node-positive |
| Ribociclib | Selected high-risk patients |

### Radiotherapy

#### After Breast-Conserving Surgery
| Recommendation | Details |
|----------------|---------|
| Whole breast RT | Standard of care |
| Boost | Consider for high-risk |
| Hypofractionation | Preferred regimen (40 Gy/15 fx) |
| Partial breast irradiation | Selected low-risk patients |

#### Post-Mastectomy Radiotherapy
| Indication | Details |
|------------|---------|
| ≥4 positive nodes | Strongly recommended |
| 1-3 positive nodes | Consider based on risk factors |
| T3/T4 tumors | Recommended |
| Positive margins | Recommended |

#### Regional Nodal Irradiation
| Indication | Details |
|------------|---------|
| ≥4 positive nodes | Recommended |
| High-risk node-positive | Consider |
| Limited nodal disease | May be omitted with adequate surgery |

### Special Populations

#### Young Women (<40 years)
| Consideration | Recommendation |
|---------------|----------------|
| Fertility preservation | Discuss before treatment |
| Ovarian suppression | Consider with endocrine therapy |
| Genetic testing | Higher rate of hereditary cancer |
| Psychosocial support | Address unique concerns |

#### Elderly Patients
| Consideration | Recommendation |
|---------------|----------------|
| Functional status | Guide treatment intensity |
| Comorbidities | Assess competing risks |
| Treatment tolerance | May modify approach |
| Omission of RT | Consider in selected cases |

#### Pregnancy-Associated Breast Cancer
| Recommendation | Details |
|----------------|---------|
| Surgery | Safe during pregnancy |
| Chemotherapy | After first trimester |
| Endocrine/HER2 therapy | Delay until after delivery |
| Radiotherapy | Delay until after delivery |

### Follow-Up

#### Surveillance Schedule
| Interval | Visit |
|----------|-------|
| Years 1-3 | Every 3-6 months |
| Years 4-5 | Every 6-12 months |
| After 5 years | Annually |

#### Surveillance Components
| Test | Frequency |
|------|-----------|
| Clinical examination | Each visit |
| Mammography | Annually |
| Routine blood tests | Not recommended |
| Tumor markers | Not recommended for routine |
| Imaging for metastases | Only if symptomatic |
