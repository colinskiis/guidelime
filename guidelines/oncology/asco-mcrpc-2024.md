## Scope
Evidence-based recommendations for systemic treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), including sequencing of therapies, genomic testing, and management of specific subtypes.

## Key Recommendations

### Genomic Testing

#### Recommended Testing (Strong)
- All patients with mCRPC should undergo **germline and somatic tumor testing**
- Test for:
  - BRCA1/2 mutations
  - Other HRR gene mutations (ATM, PALB2, CDK12, CHEK2)
  - MSI-H/dMMR
  - PSMA expression (for radioligand eligibility)

### First-Line mCRPC Treatment

#### Standard Options
| Treatment | Setting |
|-----------|---------|
| Docetaxel | Standard first-line chemotherapy |
| Abiraterone + prednisone | If not used in mCSPC setting |
| Enzalutamide | If not used in mCSPC setting |
| Apalutamide | If not used in mCSPC setting |
| Darolutamide | If not used in mCSPC setting |

#### Sequencing Principles
- Avoid repeating same drug class
- If AR-targeted therapy used in mCSPC, consider chemotherapy for mCRPC
- If chemotherapy used in mCSPC, AR-targeted therapy is appropriate

### Subsequent Lines of Therapy

#### Second-Line Options
- Switch between chemotherapy and AR-targeted therapy
- Consider PARP inhibitor if HRR mutation present
- Consider Lutetium-177 PSMA if PSMA-positive

#### PARP Inhibitors
- **Olaparib**: BRCA1/2-mutated mCRPC
- **Rucaparib**: BRCA-mutated mCRPC
- **Talazoparib + enzalutamide**: HRR-mutated mCRPC
- **Niraparib + abiraterone**: BRCA-mutated mCRPC

### Radioligand Therapy

#### Lutetium-177 PSMA-617 (177Lu-PSMA)
- For PSMA-positive mCRPC
- After prior AR-targeted therapy AND taxane chemotherapy
- Requires PSMA PET confirmation (positive uptake)

#### PSMA PET Tracers
- 68Ga-PSMA-11
- 18F-piflufolastat (Pylarify)
- 18F-flotufolastat

### Immunotherapy

#### Pembrolizumab
- For MSI-H or dMMR mCRPC
- After prior therapy

### Chemotherapy

#### Docetaxel
- 75 mg/m² every 3 weeks with prednisone
- First-line mCRPC if AR therapy used earlier

#### Cabazitaxel
- Post-docetaxel setting
- 25 mg/m² every 3 weeks
- Reduces dose to 20 mg/m² if concerns

### Bone-Targeted Agents
- Denosumab or zoledronic acid for bone metastases
- Reduces skeletal-related events
- Monitor calcium, dental health

### Small Cell/Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer
- Platinum-based chemotherapy (cisplatin/etoposide or carboplatin/etoposide)
- Consider clinical trials
- Poor prognosis

## Treatment Selection Factors
- Prior therapies received
- Genomic profile
- PSMA expression status
- Performance status
- Patient preference
- Comorbidities
