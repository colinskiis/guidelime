## Scope
2024 USPSTF recommendation statement on screening for lung cancer with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT).

## Key Recommendations

### Who Should Be Screened (Grade B Recommendation)
- Adults aged **50 to 80 years** with a **20 pack-year smoking history** who are **current smokers or quit within the past 15 years**.
- Screening should be discontinued if the patient has not smoked for 15 years or develops a health problem limiting life expectancy or ability/willingness to undergo curative lung surgery.

### How to Screen
- **Annual low-dose CT (LDCT)** of the chest.
- Screening should be performed at facilities with expertise in LDCT interpretation and lung nodule management.

### Shared Decision-Making
- A discussion between clinician and patient about benefits (mortality reduction), harms (false positives, overdiagnosis, radiation exposure, incidental findings), and the importance of continued tobacco cessation.

### Benefits
- LDCT screening reduces lung cancer mortality by approximately 20% compared to no screening or chest X-ray.
- Early-stage detection allows for curative surgical resection.

### Potential Harms
- False-positive results leading to additional imaging or invasive procedures.
- Overdiagnosis of indolent cancers.
- Radiation exposure (though LDCT is low dose).
- Psychological distress.

### Smoking Cessation
- Regardless of screening decision, all current smokers should be offered tobacco cessation interventions.
