## Scope
2024 NCCN guidelines on the risk stratification and management of prostate cancer across all stages.

## Key Recommendations

### Risk Stratification (Localized Disease)
- **Very Low Risk**: Gleason 6, PSA <10, clinical stage T1c, <3 positive cores, <50% cancer in any core.
- **Low Risk**: Gleason 6, PSA <10, T1-T2a.
- **Intermediate Risk**: Gleason 7 or PSA 10-20 or T2b-T2c.
- **High Risk**: Gleason 8-10 or PSA >20 or T3a.
- **Very High Risk / Locally Advanced**: T3b-T4, primary Gleason 5, >4 cores with Gleason 8-10.

### Management by Risk

#### Very Low / Low Risk
- **Active Surveillance**: Preferred for most patients. Serial PSA, DRE, repeat biopsy per protocol (consider MRI-targeted biopsy).
- Definitive treatment (prostatectomy or radiation) if disease progression or patient preference.

#### Intermediate Risk
- Active surveillance may be considered for favorable intermediate risk (Gleason 3+4, <50% cores positive).
- Definitive treatment: Radical prostatectomy (± pelvic LND) OR radiation therapy (EBRT ± brachytherapy ± short-term ADT).

#### High / Very High Risk
- Radical prostatectomy with pelvic lymph node dissection OR radiation therapy (EBRT ± brachytherapy + long-term ADT 18-36 months).

### Metastatic Hormone-Sensitive Prostate Cancer (mHSPC)
- ADT backbone + intensification with: abiraterone, enzalutamide, apalutamide, darolutamide, or docetaxel.
- Triplet therapy (ADT + novel hormonal agent + docetaxel) for high-volume/high-risk mHSPC.

### Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC)
- Sequencing of novel hormonal agents, chemotherapy (docetaxel, cabazitaxel), PARP inhibitors (for HRR mutations), Lutetium-177 PSMA, sipuleucel-T.
- Germline and somatic testing for BRCA1/2 and other DNA repair genes.

### Imaging
- MRI for local staging, PSMA PET-CT for staging and recurrence detection.
