## Scope
Comprehensive evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis, staging, and treatment of common cancers during pregnancy, prioritizing both maternal outcomes and fetal safety.

## Key Recommendations

### Multi-disciplinary Team (MDT)
- **Requirement**: Management must involve a coordinated MDT including Medical Oncology, Surgical Oncology, Maternal-Fetal Medicine (MFM), Radiology, Neonatology, and Oncology Nursing.
- **Ethics and Support**: Early involvement of ethics committees and psychosocial support is highly recommended.

### Diagnostic Imaging
- **Safety**: Ultrasound and MRI (without gadolinium) are the preferred imaging modalities.
- **Radiation**: Necessary diagnostic imaging (e.g., chest X-ray, staging CT) should not be withheld if essential for maternal care, but should use fetal shielding and low-dose protocols.
- **Gadolinium**: Avoid gadolinium-based MRI contrast agents unless the potential benefit to the mother clearly outweighs the potential risk to the fetus.

### Treatment by Trimester
- **First Trimester**: Surgery is generally safe. Chemotherapy should be avoided due to the high risk of organogenesis disruption and spontaneous abortion.
- **Second and Third Trimesters**: 
  - **Chemotherapy**: Many standard cytotoxic regimens can be safely administered after the period of organogenesis (>12-14 weeks).
  - **Surgery**: Generally safe throughout the second and third trimesters.
- **Delivery Planning**: Aim for a near-term delivery (≥37 weeks) if possible. Avoid chemotherapy for 3 weeks prior to the anticipated delivery date to prevent neonatal myelosuppression.

### Pharmacological Considerations
- **Targeted Therapies**: Most targeted agents (e.g., monoclonal antibodies like trastuzumab) and immunotherapy (e.g., pembrolizumab) should be avoided due to limited safety data and known risks to fetal development.
- **Supportive Care**: Standard antiemetics (e.g., ondansetron) and G-CSF can be used as indicated.

### Specific Cancers
- **Breast Cancer**: Surgery and certain chemotherapy (e.g., AC, paclitaxel) are feasible in the 2nd/3rd trimesters. Radiation and endocrine therapy (tamoxifen) should be deferred until postpartum.
- **Cervical Cancer**: Management depends on the stage and gestational age; options include surveillance, surgery (conization/trachelectomy), or neoadjuvant chemotherapy to delay definitive treatment until after delivery.

### Post-treatment Follow-up
- **Placental Examination**: Pathological examination of the placenta is recommended for all cases of maternal cancer during pregnancy to screen for rare metastasis.
- **Neonatal Follow-up**: Long-term follow-up of children exposed to in utero chemotherapy is encouraged to monitor for potential developmental or health impacts.
