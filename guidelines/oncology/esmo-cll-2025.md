## Scope
Updated evidence-based recommendations from ESMO for the management of patients with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL), incorporating new data on targeted therapies and the role of measurable residual disease (MRD).

## Key Recommendations

### Diagnosis and Prognostication
- **Diagnosis**: Requires a peripheral blood lymphocytosis ≥5 x 10^9/L with a characteristic immunophenotype (CD5+, CD19+, CD23+, weak sIg, CD20 low).
- **TP53 and IGHV**: Mandatory testing for TP53 mutation/deletion and IGHV mutational status prior to starting frontline therapy.

### Frontline Therapy
- **Fit Patients (Regardless of IGHV)**: Preferred options include:
    - **BTK Inhibitors** (e.g., Acalabrutinib, Zanubrutinib) continuous therapy.
    - **Venetoclax + Obinutuzumab** fixed-duration therapy (1 year).
- **TP53 Disruption**: Continuous BTK inhibitors are the preferred strategy for patients with TP53 mutation or del(17p).

### Role of Measurable Residual Disease (MRD)
- **New Standard**: Recommends the use of MRD (threshold <10^-4) as a secondary endpoint to guide the duration of treatment in clinical trials and increasingly in routine practice (specifically for Venetoclax-based combinations).

### Management of Relapsed/Refractory Disease
- **Class Switching**: If a patient relapses on a BTK inhibitor, switching to a Venetoclax-based regimen is recommended, and vice-versa.
- **Pirtobrutinib**: Recommended as a preferred option for patients who have failed both covalent BTK inhibitors and BCL2 inhibitors.

### Supportive Care
- **Infection Prophylaxis**: High risk of opportunistic infections; recommends monitoring for HBV reactivation and considering prophylaxis for PJP/VZV during intensive therapy.
- **Vaccination**: Annual influenza and up-to-date COVID-19/Pneumococcal vaccination are strongly recommended, ideally before starting treatment.

### Richter Transformation
- **Biopsy**: Mandatory lymph node biopsy if Richter transformation is suspected (e.g., rapid lymph node growth, B-symptoms, rising LDH).
- **Management**: Aggressive chemo-immunotherapy followed by stem cell transplantation in eligible patients remains the standard.
