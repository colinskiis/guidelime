## Scope
Updated ACSM roundtable consensus on exercise guidelines for cancer survivors across the continuum of care.

## Key Recommendations

### General Principles
- Exercise is safe and beneficial for most cancer survivors during and after treatment.
- Recommend supervised exercise programs when available, particularly for patients with complex needs.

### Exercise Prescription
- **Aerobic Exercise**: 150 minutes of moderate-intensity OR 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity per week.
- **Resistance Training**: At least 2 sessions per week involving major muscle groups.
- **Flexibility**: Stretching after workouts.
- **Prehabilitation**: Exercise before surgery or treatment initiation may improve post-treatment recovery.

### Specific Benefits
- **Cancer-Related Fatigue (CRF)**: Aerobic and combined aerobic-resistance training are effective interventions for reducing CRF.
- **Anxiety/Depression**: Exercise has moderate benefits for psychological well-being.
- **Physical Function**: Improves strength, cardiorespiratory fitness, and overall physical function.
- **Quality of Life**: Consistent improvements reported across cancer types.

### Considerations by Cancer Type
- Breast, prostate, colorectal, and hematologic cancers have the most evidence.
- Tailor programs for patients with bone metastases (avoid high-impact), lymphedema (supervised, gradual progression), or cardiotoxicity (monitor closely).

### Safety
- Assess for contraindications (severe anemia, active infection, significant cardiac disease).
- Modify intensity and volume during acute treatment phases.
