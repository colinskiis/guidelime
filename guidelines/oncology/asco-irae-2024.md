## Scope
2024 ASCO clinical practice guideline update on the recognition and management of immune-related adverse events (irAEs) associated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs).

## Key Recommendations

### General Principles
- Patient education on recognizing irAE symptoms.
- Baseline labs: CBC, CMP (including LFTs, creatinine), TSH, HbA1c.
- Monitor at each treatment and between cycles; low threshold for evaluation of new symptoms.

### Grading (CTCAE-based)
- **Grade 1**: Mild; often continue ICI with close monitoring.
- **Grade 2**: Moderate; hold ICI; low-dose corticosteroids (prednisone 0.5-1 mg/kg).
- **Grade 3**: Severe; hold ICI; high-dose corticosteroids (prednisone 1-2 mg/kg).
- **Grade 4**: Life-threatening; permanently discontinue ICI; high-dose IV corticosteroids; consider additional immunosuppression.

### Organ-Specific Management

#### Colitis
- Rule out infection (C. diff, CMV).
- Mild: Supportive care.
- Moderate-Severe: Corticosteroids; infliximab or vedolizumab for steroid-refractory cases.

#### Hepatitis
- Exclude viral hepatitis, drug-induced injury.
- Corticosteroids; mycophenolate mofetil for refractory.

#### Pneumonitis
- High-dose corticosteroids; bronchoscopy with BAL may help exclude infection.
- Infliximab or mycophenolate for refractory cases.

#### Endocrinopathies
- **Hypothyroidism**: Thyroid hormone replacement (usually permanent).
- **Hyperthyroidism**: May progress to hypothyroidism; beta-blockers for symptoms.
- **Hypophysitis**: Hormone replacement (cortisol, thyroid, testosterone as needed).
- **Adrenal Insufficiency**: Corticosteroid replacement (hydrocortisone).
- **Type 1 Diabetes (Insulin-Requiring)**: Prompt insulin initiation.

#### Neurologic (Myasthenia Gravis, Encephalitis, GBS)
- Specialty consultation; high-dose steroids; IVIG or plasmapheresis.

### Resuming ICI
- Consider resuming after Grade 2 irAE resolution on low-dose steroids.
- Generally do not resume after Grade 3-4 irAEs (case-by-case for certain irAEs like endocrinopathies managed with replacement).
