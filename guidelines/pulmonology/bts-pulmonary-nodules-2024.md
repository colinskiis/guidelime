## Scope
2024 update to the British Thoracic Society guideline on the investigation and management of incidentally detected pulmonary nodules.

## Key Recommendations

### Initial Assessment
- Characterize nodule by size, morphology (solid, part-solid, ground-glass), location, and presence of calcification or fat.
- Review prior imaging if available to assess stability.

### Risk Stratification
- Use validated risk prediction models (e.g., Brock University model, Herder model) to estimate malignancy probability.
- Consider patient factors: smoking history, age, cancer history, COPD, nodule characteristics.

### Management by Nodule Type

#### Solid Nodules
- **<5 mm**: No routine follow-up in low-risk patients; consider 12-month CT in high-risk.
- **5-8 mm**: CT surveillance at 3 and 12 months (high-risk) or 12 months (low-risk).
- **>8 mm**: Consider PET-CT, image-guided biopsy, or surgical resection depending on malignancy probability.

#### Part-Solid (Subsolid) Nodules
- Higher malignancy potential with solid component. Manage based on solid component size.
- If persistent with ≥6 mm solid component, consider PET and/or resection.

#### Ground-Glass Nodules (GGN)
- Often indolent. Surveillance at longer intervals (3-6 months initially, then annually).
- Consider resection if growing or if solid component develops.

### PET-CT
- Useful for nodules >8 mm. Limited sensitivity for smaller or pure GGN lesions.

### Biopsy
- CT-guided or bronchoscopic biopsy for nodules with moderate-high malignancy probability when non-surgical diagnosis is preferred.

### Multidisciplinary Team (MDT)
- Discuss complex or high-risk cases in a lung MDT.
