## Scope
Comprehensive 2025 update of the ERS guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and management of bronchiectasis in adults.

## Key Recommendations

### Diagnosis and Investigation
- **HRCT**: The diagnostic gold standard. Should be performed in any patient with chronic productive cough.
- **Etiological Workup**: Recommended to identify treatable causes, including tests for immunodeficiencies (IgG, IgA, IgM), allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) (total IgE, specific IgE to Aspergillus), alpha-1 antitrypsin, and cystic fibrosis (sweat test, genetics).
- **Sputum Culture**: At baseline and during exacerbations to guide antibiotic therapy. *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* colonization is a key prognostic indicator.

### Airway Clearance
- **Strong Recommendation**: All patients with chronic sputum production should be taught and regularly perform airway clearance techniques (ACT).
- **Pulmonary Rehabilitation**: Should be offered to patients with breathlessness or reduced exercise tolerance.

### Long-term Macrolide Therapy
- **Indications**: Recommended for patients with ≥3 exacerbations per year and/or chronic *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* infection.
- **Regimen**: Low-dose azithromycin (e.g., 250-500mg three times per week) for at least 12 months.
- **Monitoring**: Baseline and periodic ECG (for QTc), LFTs, and assessment for hearing changes.

### Inhaled Antibiotics
- May be considered for patients with chronic *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* infection who continue to have exacerbations despite oral macrolide therapy.

### Management of Exacerbations
- **Antibiotic Choice**: Guided by prior sputum cultures. For *P. aeruginosa*, use ciprofloxacin or an antipseudomonal IV antibiotic.
- **Duration**: Typically 14 days for exacerbations.

### Eradication Therapy
- A 2-week course of antipseudomonal antibiotic should be attempted when *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* is first isolated.
