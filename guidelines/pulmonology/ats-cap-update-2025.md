## Scope
2025 update to the ATS clinical practice guideline for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), clarifying antibiotic choice, treatment duration, and the role of corticosteroids in adults.

## Key Recommendations

### Diagnosis
- **Imaging**: Chest X-ray remains the standard for diagnosis. CT chest should be reserved for cases with diagnostic uncertainty or for detecting complications.
- **Microbiology**: Routine sputum cultures and blood cultures are recommended for hospitalized patients to guide targeted antibiotic therapy and epidemiologic surveillance.

### Outpatient Management
- **Healthy Adults (No Comorbidities)**: Amoxicillin OR doxycycline OR a macrolide (if local resistance <25%) as monotherapy.
- **Adults with Comorbidities**: An extended-spectrum antibiotic (e.g., amoxicillin-clavulanate or cephalosporin) PLUS a macrolide or doxycycline; OR a respiratory fluoroquinolone (moxifloxacin or levofloxacin) as monotherapy.

### Inpatient Management
- **Non-ICU**: Beta-lactam (e.g., ampicillin-sulbactam, ceftriaxone) PLUS a macrolide is preferred. Respiratory fluoroquinolone monotherapy is an alternative.
- **ICU**: Beta-lactam PLUS a macrolide is the standard. If *Pseudomonas* or MRSA risk factors are present, expand coverage accordingly.

### Treatment Duration
- **Short Course**: Recommends treatment for a minimum of 5 days, with extension only if the patient is not afebrile and clinically stable at day 5.
- **Procalcitonin**: Procalcitonin-guided discontinuation may be considered to reduce antibiotic duration.

### Adjunctive Corticosteroids
- **Severe CAP**: Corticosteroids (e.g., hydrocortisone or methylprednisolone) may be considered for patients with severe CAP and/or high inflammatory markers (e.g., CRP) to reduce mortality and length of stay.
