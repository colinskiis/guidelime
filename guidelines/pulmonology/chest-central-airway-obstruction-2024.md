## Scope
First comprehensive CHEST guideline for the management of symptomatic central airway obstruction (CAO) from malignant and benign causes.

## Key Recommendations

### Definition
- **Central Airway Obstruction (CAO)**: Obstruction of the trachea, main bronchi, bronchus intermedius, or lobar bronchi caused by intrinsic (intraluminal) or extrinsic (extraluminal compression) pathology.

### Assessment
- **Symptoms**: Dyspnea, stridor, cough, hemoptysis, post-obstructive pneumonia.
- **CT Imaging**: High-resolution CT with 3D reconstruction is recommended for characterizing the location, degree, and nature of obstruction.
- **Bronchoscopy**: Both diagnostic and therapeutic; assess dynamic airway collapse.

### Therapeutic Bronchoscopy (Interventional Pulmonology)
For symptomatic patients with significant CAO and reasonable life expectancy/performance status.
- **Mechanical Debridement**: Rigid or flexible bronchoscopy with coring, microdebrider.
- **Ablative Techniques**:
  - Laser (Nd:YAG, CO2)
  - Electrocautery / Argon Plasma Coagulation (APC)
  - Cryotherapy (spray or probe)
- **Airway Stenting**: Silicone or self-expanding metallic stents (SEMS) for extrinsic compression or to maintain patency after debridement. Covered SEMS may be preferred for malignant disease.

### Malignant CAO
- Therapeutic bronchoscopy can provide rapid palliation of dyspnea and improve quality of life.
- Should be integrated with systemic cancer therapy (chemotherapy, radiation) and palliative care.

### Benign CAO
- Causes include post-intubation stenosis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and benign tumors.
- Endoscopic dilation, steroid injection, and silicone stenting are mainstays. Surgical resection may be curative in select cases.

### Multidisciplinary Care
- Management should involve interventional pulmonology, thoracic surgery, oncology, radiation oncology, and palliative care.
