## Scope
Official clinical practice guideline for diagnosis and treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in immunocompetent adults.

## Key Recommendations

### Site of Care Decisions
- Use validated severity scores (PSI or CURB-65) to determine site of care
- Clinical judgment should supplement severity scores
- Direct admission to ICU for patients with septic shock or respiratory failure

### Diagnostic Testing
- **Outpatients**: Routine microbiological testing not recommended
- **Inpatients**: Blood cultures and sputum culture recommended for severe CAP
- **Procalcitonin**: Not recommended to guide initiation of antibiotics (against previous practice)
- **Legionella and pneumococcal urinary antigens**: Recommended for severe CAP

### Empiric Antibiotic Therapy

#### Outpatient (Healthy, No Comorbidities)
- Amoxicillin 1g TID, OR
- Doxycycline 100mg BID, OR
- Azithromycin (only if local pneumococcal resistance <25%)

#### Outpatient (With Comorbidities)
- Amoxicillin/clavulanate + macrolide or doxycycline, OR
- Cefpodoxime or cefuroxime + macrolide or doxycycline, OR
- Respiratory fluoroquinolone monotherapy

#### Inpatient (Non-Severe)
- Beta-lactam + macrolide, OR
- Respiratory fluoroquinolone monotherapy

#### Inpatient (Severe CAP)
- Beta-lactam + macrolide, OR
- Beta-lactam + respiratory fluoroquinolone

### MRSA and Pseudomonas Coverage
- Only add coverage if locally validated risk factors present
- Abandon the term "healthcare-associated pneumonia" (HCAP)

### Corticosteroids
- Not routinely recommended
- May consider in CAP with refractory septic shock

### Duration of Therapy
- Minimum 5 days
- Continue until clinically stable for 48-72 hours
- Longer courses not routinely necessary

## Major Changes from Previous Guidelines
- Abandoned HCAP category
- GRADE methodology adopted
- Procalcitonin not recommended for antibiotic initiation decisions
- Corticosteroids not routinely recommended
