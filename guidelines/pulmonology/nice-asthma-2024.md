## Scope
2024 update to NICE guideline NG80 on the diagnosis, monitoring, and management of asthma in adults and children over 5 years.

## Key Recommendations

### Diagnosis
- Objective testing to confirm diagnosis:
  - **Spirometry**: FEV1/FVC ratio and bronchodilator reversibility (≥12% and ≥200 mL improvement in FEV1).
  - **FeNO (Fractional Exhaled Nitric Oxide)**: ≥40 ppb in adults supports eosinophilic inflammation/ICS-responsive asthma.
  - **Peak Flow Variability**: >20% diurnal variation.
- Do not diagnose on symptoms alone.

### Assessing Control
- Assess symptoms, exacerbation frequency, lung function, inhaler technique, adherence at every review.
- Use validated questionnaires (ACQ, ACT).

### Stepwise Treatment (Adults)

#### Step 1 (SABA as Needed)
- No longer recommended as maintenance for most patients. Low-dose ICS recommended from the start.

#### Step 2 (Low-Dose ICS)
- First-line maintenance therapy.
- SABA as needed or ICS-formoterol as needed (MART-ready).

#### Step 3 (Low-Dose ICS + LABA)
- Add LABA (formoterol, salmeterol) if uncontrolled on ICS alone.
- Consider MART (Maintenance And Reliever Therapy) with ICS-formoterol.

#### Step 4 (Medium-Dose ICS + LABA)
- Increase ICS dose.
- Consider add-on: LTRA, LAMA (tiotropium).

#### Step 5 (Specialist/Biologic Therapy)
- Refer to specialist.
- **Biologic Therapies**: Anti-IgE (omalizumab), anti-IL5/5R (mepolizumab, benralizumab, reslizumab), anti-IL4Rα (dupilumab), anti-TSLP (tezepelumab) for severe eosinophilic or allergic asthma.
- Consider oral corticosteroids as last resort.

### Self-Management
- Written asthma action plan for all patients.
- Teach inhaler technique; reassess regularly.
