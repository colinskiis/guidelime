## Scope
2024 update to NICE guideline NG115 on the diagnosis and management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in adults.

## Key Recommendations

### Diagnosis
- Suspect COPD in adults ≥35 years with risk factors (smoking, occupational exposure) and symptoms (dyspnea, chronic cough, sputum).
- **Spirometry**: Post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC <0.7 confirms airflow obstruction.
- Assess severity by FEV1 (GOLD staging: mild, moderate, severe, very severe).

### Non-Pharmacological Management
- **Smoking Cessation**: Most important intervention to slow progression.
- **Pulmonary Rehabilitation**: Offer to all patients with functional disability.
- **Vaccinations**: Influenza, pneumococcal, COVID-19.

### Pharmacological Management

#### Initial Therapy
- **SABA or SAMA as needed**: For occasional symptoms.
- **LAMA or LABA**: If daily symptoms or exacerbations persist.

#### Escalation
- **LAMA + LABA**: Combination for persistent symptoms or exacerbations on monotherapy.
- **LAMA + LABA + ICS (Triple Therapy)**: Consider if eosinophil count ≥300 cells/μL or ≥100 cells/μL with ≥2 moderate / ≥1 severe exacerbation per year.

#### ICS Considerations
- ICS increases pneumonia risk. Use judiciously; consider de-escalation if stable.

### Exacerbation Management
- Short-course oral corticosteroids (prednisolone 30 mg x 5 days).
- Antibiotics if purulent sputum and increased dyspnea/volume.

### Oxygen Therapy
- Long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) for resting PaO2 ≤7.3 kPa (55 mmHg) or ≤8 kPa with cor pulmonale/polycythemia.
- Ambulatory oxygen if desaturation on exertion and benefit demonstrated.

### Palliative Care
- Consider early palliative care involvement for advanced disease.
