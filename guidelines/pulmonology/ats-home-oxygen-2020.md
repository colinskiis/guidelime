## Scope
Evidence-based recommendations for prescribing long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) for adults with chronic lung disease.

## Key Recommendations

### Indications for LTOT in COPD

#### Severe Resting Hypoxemia (Strong)
Prescribe LTOT for ≥15 hours/day if:
- PaO2 ≤55 mmHg OR SpO2 ≤88%
- OR PaO2 56-59 mmHg or SpO2 89% with:
  - Peripheral edema
  - Hematocrit ≥55%
  - P pulmonale on ECG

#### Moderate Resting Hypoxemia (Conditional Against)
- PaO2 56-59 mmHg or SpO2 89-93% without qualifying conditions
- LOTT trial showed no benefit
- Do NOT routinely prescribe

#### Exertional Hypoxemia Alone
- Evidence insufficient
- Consider for severe exertional desaturation with limited exercise capacity
- Individualize decision

### Assessment for LTOT

#### When to Assess
| Timing | Action |
|--------|--------|
| At stable state | Confirm hypoxemia not transient |
| After optimization | Ensure medical therapy optimized |
| After exacerbation | Wait 30-90 days; retest |
| At hospital discharge | Confirm need at follow-up |

#### Assessment Methods
- Arterial blood gas (preferred for initial assessment)
- Pulse oximetry (acceptable for monitoring)
- Measure at rest for ≥5 minutes
- Consider exercise and sleep testing

### Oxygen Delivery Systems

#### Stationary Systems
| Type | Pros | Cons |
|------|------|------|
| Oxygen concentrator | No refills needed; lower cost | Requires electricity |
| Liquid oxygen | High capacity | Requires refills |
| Compressed gas | Simple | Heavy; requires refills |

#### Portable Systems
| Type | Notes |
|------|-------|
| Portable concentrators | Lighter; pulse-dose options |
| Small liquid units | Can be filled from home unit |
| Small cylinders | Limited duration |

#### Delivery Devices
- Nasal cannula (most common)
- Reservoir cannula (oxygen conserving)
- Transtracheal catheter (selected patients)

### Flow Rate Prescription

#### Titration Goals
- Target SpO2 ≥90% (or per patient goals)
- Adjust for rest, exertion, and sleep
- May need different flows for different activities

#### Titration Protocol
1. Start at 1-2 L/min
2. Increase by 1 L/min every 5-10 minutes
3. Check SpO2 at each level
4. Document flow to achieve SpO2 ≥90%

### Duration of Use

#### Recommendation
- Use for ≥15 hours per day
- 24-hour use if severe hypoxemia
- Include sleep hours

#### Mortality Benefit
- Demonstrated with ≥15 hours/day
- Greater benefit with more hours
- Intermittent use has uncertain benefit

### Reassessment

#### When to Reassess
| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| 60-90 days after initiation | Confirm ongoing need |
| Clinical improvement | Consider discontinuation |
| Worsening symptoms | Increase flow; evaluate cause |
| New portable equipment | Verify adequate oxygenation |

### Special Considerations

#### Air Travel
- Notify airline in advance
- FAA-approved portable concentrators
- May need higher flow at altitude
- Obtain documentation from physician

#### Smoking
- Absolute fire hazard
- Do NOT prescribe with ongoing smoking
- Fire safety counseling essential

#### Driving
- No specific restrictions
- Ensure cognitive function adequate
- Use portable system

### Other Chronic Lung Diseases

#### Interstitial Lung Disease
- Similar criteria as COPD
- More often develop hypoxemia with exertion
- Earlier progression may occur

#### Pulmonary Hypertension
- May benefit from oxygen
- Individualize based on hypoxemia

#### Cystic Fibrosis
- Similar approach to other chronic lung diseases
- Consider as part of comprehensive care

### Palliative Oxygen

#### Dyspnea Without Hypoxemia
- Evidence does not support benefit
- May consider short-term trial
- Alternative approaches for dyspnea

### Patient Education
- Proper use and maintenance of equipment
- Fire safety (no smoking, keep away from flames)
- When and how to adjust flow
- Signs of worsening requiring evaluation
- Importance of adherence

### Documentation
- Qualifying blood gas or oximetry values
- Flow rate prescription
- Duration of use recommendation
- Follow-up plan
