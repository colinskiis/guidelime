## Scope
Evidence-based recommendations for diagnosis and treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) in nonimmunocompromised adults.

## Key Definitions
- **HAP**: Pneumonia occurring ≥48 hours after hospital admission
- **VAP**: Pneumonia occurring >48 hours after endotracheal intubation
- **Healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP)**: Term abandoned (no longer recommended)

## Key Recommendations

### Diagnosis

#### Recommended Approach
- **Clinical diagnosis** based on new lung infiltrate + clinical signs of infection
- **Noninvasive sampling** with semiquantitative cultures preferred over bronchoscopy
- Invasive sampling (BAL) acceptable but not required

#### When to Suspect MDR Pathogens
- Prior IV antibiotic use within 90 days
- Septic shock at time of VAP
- ARDS preceding VAP
- ≥5 days hospitalization prior to VAP
- Acute renal replacement therapy prior to VAP
- High local prevalence of MDR organisms

### Empiric Treatment

#### HAP (Not at High Risk for Mortality, No MRSA Risk Factors)
One agent with MSSA and Pseudomonas coverage:
- Piperacillin-tazobactam, OR
- Cefepime, OR
- Levofloxacin, OR
- Imipenem, OR
- Meropenem

#### HAP (High Risk for Mortality OR MRSA Risk Factors)
Two agents:
1. **Anti-MRSA**: Vancomycin OR linezolid
2. **Anti-Pseudomonal**: Piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime, ceftazidime, imipenem, meropenem, aztreonam, OR fluoroquinolone

#### VAP (No MDR Risk Factors)
One agent with Pseudomonas coverage:
- Piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime, levofloxacin, imipenem, or meropenem

#### VAP (MDR Risk Factors or High Mortality Risk)
Three agents:
1. **Anti-MRSA**: Vancomycin OR linezolid
2. **Two anti-Pseudomonal agents** from different classes

### De-escalation
- Culture results should guide de-escalation within 48-72 hours
- Narrow spectrum once organism and sensitivities known
- Stop MRSA coverage if cultures negative

### Duration of Therapy
- **7 days** for HAP and VAP (Strong recommendation)
- Procalcitonin can help guide discontinuation
- Longer courses only if inadequate clinical improvement

### Aerosolized Antibiotics
- Consider adjunctive inhaled antibiotics for MDR Gram-negative VAP
- Not as monotherapy

## Common Pathogens
- *Staphylococcus aureus* (including MRSA)
- *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*
- *Klebsiella pneumoniae*
- *Acinetobacter* species
- *Enterobacter* species

## Notes
- Local antibiograms should guide empiric therapy
- High-quality cultures before antibiotics when possible
- This guideline remains current as of 2024
