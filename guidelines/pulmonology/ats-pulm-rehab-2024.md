## Scope

This guideline provides recommendations for pulmonary rehabilitation in patients with chronic respiratory diseases, including COPD, interstitial lung disease, and bronchiectasis.

## Key Recommendations

### Indications
- COPD with dyspnea or exercise limitation (Strong recommendation)
- Interstitial lung disease
- Pre- and post-lung transplant
- Bronchiectasis with significant symptoms
- Post-acute COVID-19 with respiratory impairment (conditional)

### Program Components
**Exercise Training:**
- Aerobic training: 3-5 times/week, 20-60 min
- Resistance training for peripheral muscles
- Interval training for severe patients
- Inspiratory muscle training if indicated

**Education:**
- Self-management skills
- Medication adherence
- Breathing strategies
- Energy conservation

**Psychosocial Support:**
- Anxiety and depression screening
- Peer support groups
- Caregiver education

### Duration
- Minimum 6-8 weeks recommended
- Longer programs may provide greater benefit
- Maintenance programs to preserve gains

### Outcomes
- Improved exercise capacity (6MWD)
- Reduced dyspnea
- Enhanced quality of life
- Decreased healthcare utilization

### Post-Hospitalization
- Initiate within 3-4 weeks of hospital discharge for COPD exacerbation
- Reduces readmission rates

### Telerehabilitation
- Acceptable alternative when in-person not feasible
- Requires appropriate patient selection
- Technology support essential
