## Scope

Comprehensive evidence-based strategy for asthma diagnosis, assessment, and stepwise management in adults, adolescents, and children, including acute exacerbations and special populations.

## Notes

Updated annually. 2025 key updates: major updates in diagnosis for children <5 years, new appendix on type 2 biomarkers (blood eosinophil count, FeNO) in diagnosis. Two treatment tracks: Track 1 (preferred) uses as-needed ICS-formoterol as reliever; Track 2 uses SABA with separate ICS.
