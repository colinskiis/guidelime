# ESC/ERS Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Acute Pulmonary Embolism

## Scope
Comprehensive guidelines for diagnosis, risk stratification, and management of acute pulmonary embolism.

## Key Recommendations

### Diagnosis

#### Clinical Probability Assessment
- Use validated prediction rules: **Wells score** or **Geneva score**
- Classify as low, intermediate, or high probability

#### D-dimer Testing
- Use age-adjusted D-dimer cutoff (age × 10 μg/L for patients >50 years)
- Negative D-dimer excludes PE in low/intermediate probability patients

#### Imaging
- **CTPA (CT Pulmonary Angiography)**: First-line imaging for suspected PE
- **V/Q scan**: Alternative if CTPA contraindicated
- **Compression ultrasonography**: For DVT detection; positive CUS confirms VTE

### Risk Stratification

#### Classification
| Risk Level | Criteria | Short-term Mortality |
|------------|----------|---------------------|
| High-risk (Massive) | Hemodynamic instability (shock, hypotension) | >15% |
| Intermediate-high | RV dysfunction + elevated troponin | 3-15% |
| Intermediate-low | RV dysfunction OR elevated troponin | 3-15% |
| Low-risk | None of the above | <3% |

#### Tools
- **PESI or sPESI** for prognostic assessment
- **Echocardiography**: RV dysfunction assessment
- **Cardiac biomarkers**: Troponin, BNP/NT-proBNP

### Treatment

#### High-Risk PE (Massive)
- **Primary reperfusion therapy** recommended
- **Systemic thrombolysis**: Alteplase 100 mg over 2 hours (Class I)
- **Surgical embolectomy**: If thrombolysis contraindicated or failed
- **Catheter-directed therapy**: Alternative if available
- Anticoagulation with UFH (enables rapid reversal if bleeding)

#### Intermediate-High Risk PE
- **Anticoagulation** is primary treatment
- **Rescue thrombolysis** if hemodynamic decompensation occurs
- Close monitoring in ICU/step-down

#### Low/Intermediate-Low Risk PE
- **Anticoagulation** alone
- Consider early discharge for low-risk patients

### Anticoagulation

#### Initial Treatment (First 5-21 Days)
| Option | Details |
|--------|---------|
| DOAC | Rivaroxaban or apixaban (preferred) - no parenteral lead-in needed |
| LMWH → DOAC | Edoxaban or dabigatran after 5+ days LMWH |
| LMWH → VKA | Target INR 2.0-3.0 |
| UFH | For high-risk PE or when rapid reversal may be needed |

#### Duration of Anticoagulation
| Scenario | Minimum Duration |
|----------|------------------|
| Provoked PE (surgery, trauma) | 3 months |
| Unprovoked PE | ≥3 months, consider extended |
| Recurrent VTE | Extended/indefinite |
| Cancer-associated | At least 6 months; often indefinite |

#### Extended Anticoagulation
- Consider reduced-dose rivaroxaban (10 mg) or apixaban (2.5 mg BID) for extended therapy
- Reassess annually for benefits vs bleeding risk

### PE in Pregnancy
- LMWH is treatment of choice (DOACs contraindicated)
- Avoid warfarin (teratogenic)

### Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension (CTEPH)
- Screen for CTEPH 3-6 months after acute PE if persistent symptoms
- Refer to expert center for pulmonary endarterectomy evaluation
- Medical therapy (riociguat) for inoperable cases

## Key Messages
- Risk stratification guides treatment intensity
- DOACs preferred for most patients
- Thrombolysis reserved for high-risk PE
- Extended anticoagulation decision based on individual risk-benefit
