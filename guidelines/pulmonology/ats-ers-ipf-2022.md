# ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT Clinical Practice Guideline: Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis and Progressive Pulmonary Fibrosis

## Scope
Updated clinical practice guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and progressive pulmonary fibrosis (PPF) in adults.

## Key Recommendations

### Diagnosis of IPF

#### HRCT Patterns
| Pattern | Recommendation |
|---------|----------------|
| Definite UIP | Diagnosis of IPF if clinical context consistent |
| Probable UIP | Discuss in multidisciplinary team; may diagnose IPF |
| Indeterminate for UIP | Surgical lung biopsy or transbronchial cryobiopsy may be needed |
| Alternative diagnosis | Investigate other causes |

#### UIP Pattern Features
- Basal and peripheral predominant
- Honeycombing (with or without traction bronchiectasis)
- Absence of features inconsistent with UIP

#### Multidisciplinary Discussion
- Recommended for all suspected IPF cases
- Includes pulmonologist, radiologist, pathologist

### Antifibrotic Treatment

#### Nintedanib (Conditional Recommendation)
- Approved for IPF and PPF
- Reduces FVC decline by ~50%
- Common side effects: Diarrhea, nausea

#### Pirfenidone (Conditional Recommendation)
- Approved for IPF
- Reduces FVC decline
- Common side effects: GI upset, photosensitivity, rash

#### Treatment Recommendations
- Offer antifibrotic therapy to all IPF patients (Conditional)
- Choice between nintedanib and pirfenidone based on patient factors
- No head-to-head comparison; both effective

### Progressive Pulmonary Fibrosis (PPF)

#### Definition
PPF occurs in patients with ILD other than IPF who meet criteria for progression:
- Worsening respiratory symptoms
- Physiological decline (FVC or DLCO)
- Radiological progression

#### Criteria for Progression (within 1 year)
At least 2 of 3:
1. Worsening symptoms
2. FVC decline ≥5% absolute OR DLCO decline ≥10% absolute
3. Radiological progression

#### Treatment of PPF
- **Nintedanib** approved for PPF (based on INBUILD trial)
- Consider after optimizing treatment of underlying ILD

### Gastroesophageal Reflux

#### Recommendation (Conditional Against)
- Routine anti-reflux treatment not recommended for IPF
- May be considered for symptomatic GERD

### Acute Exacerbations

#### Definition
- Acute worsening of dyspnea (within 1 month)
- New bilateral ground-glass opacities on HRCT
- Not fully explained by cardiac failure or fluid overload

#### Management
- Supportive care
- Consider high-dose corticosteroids (limited evidence)
- Rule out infection
- High mortality

### Supportive Care

#### Oxygen Therapy
- For resting or exertional hypoxemia
- Improves quality of life

#### Pulmonary Rehabilitation
- Recommended for all IPF patients
- Improves exercise tolerance and quality of life

#### Lung Transplantation
- Consider early referral for eligible patients
- Only curative option for IPF
- Refer when FVC <80% or DLCO <40%

### Monitoring
- Pulmonary function tests (FVC, DLCO) every 3-6 months
- Symptom assessment
- HRCT as clinically indicated

## Key Points
- Multidisciplinary diagnosis recommended
- Antifibrotic therapy slows but does not stop progression
- Early referral for transplant evaluation
- Palliative care should be integrated early
