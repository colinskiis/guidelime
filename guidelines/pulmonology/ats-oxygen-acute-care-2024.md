## Scope
2024 ATS guideline on the appropriate use and targeting of oxygen therapy in hospitalized patients with hypoxemia.

## Key Recommendations

### SpO2 Targets (Avoiding Hyperoxia)
- **General Target**: Titrate oxygen to SpO2 88-92% or 92-96% depending on clinical context. Avoid routinely targeting SpO2 >96%.
- **COPD Patients**: Target SpO2 88-92% to reduce risk of hypercapnia.
- **Critically Ill (Non-COPD)**: Target SpO2 92-96%; avoid prolonged hyperoxia (SpO2 >96-98%).

### Evidence for Conservative Oxygen Targets
- Multiple RCTs suggest that targeting lower SpO2 (avoiding hyperoxia) is at least as safe as and may reduce mortality compared to liberal oxygen use.

### High-Flow Nasal Cannula (HFNC)
- HFNC is recommended for patients with non-hypercapnic hypoxemic respiratory failure as an alternative to conventional oxygen or NIV.
- Benefits: Better oxygenation, reduced work of breathing, possible reduction in intubation rates.

### Delivery Systems
- **Low-Flow Systems**: Nasal cannula (1-6 L/min), simple mask.
- **High-Flow Systems**: HFNC (up to 60 L/min).
- **Non-Invasive Ventilation (NIV)**: CPAP/BiPAP for specific indications (COPD exacerbation, cardiogenic pulmonary edema).

### Monitoring
- Continuous pulse oximetry for unstable or critically ill patients.
- ABG for assessment of PaCO2, pH, and PaO2 when indicated.

### Weaning Oxygen
- Protocolized oxygen weaning to minimize unnecessary supplemental oxygen use.
