## Scope
2024 ERS/ATS guideline update on the diagnosis and management of interstitial lung diseases (ILDs), including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), hypersensitivity pneumonitis, connective tissue disease-associated ILD, and other fibrotic ILDs.

## Key Recommendations

### Diagnosis
- **HRCT Chest**: Essential for diagnosis and pattern recognition.
- **UIP Pattern (Typical)**: Subpleural, basal-predominant honeycombing, reticulation, traction bronchiectasis. If typical UIP on HRCT in clinical context of IPF, lung biopsy may NOT be required.
- **Probable/Indeterminate UIP**: May require surgical lung biopsy or cryobiopsy for diagnosis.
- **Serological Testing**: ANA, RF, anti-CCP, myositis panel to rule out CTD-ILD.
- **Exposure History**: Environmental/occupational exposures (e.g., hypersensitivity pneumonitis).

### Multidisciplinary Discussion (MDD)
- All ILD diagnoses should involve MDD with pulmonologist, radiologist, pathologist.

### Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF)

#### Antifibrotic Therapy
- **Pirfenidone or Nintedanib**: Recommended for patients with IPF. Slows FVC decline. Start early.
- Both have comparable efficacy; choice based on side effect profile and patient factors.

#### Supportive Care
- Pulmonary rehabilitation.
- Oxygen therapy if hypoxemic.
- Treatment of GERD, cough.

#### Lung Transplant
- Refer appropriate candidates early.

### Progressive Pulmonary Fibrosis (PPF) / Non-IPF Fibrotic ILD
- **Nintedanib**: Approved for progressive fibrotic ILD (INBUILD trial). Consider for patients with non-IPF ILD showing progression despite standard treatment.

### CTD-ILD
- Treat underlying CTD first (immunosuppression).
- Add antifibrotics if progressive fibrosis despite treatment.

### Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis (HP)
- Antigen avoidance is key.
- Immunosuppression (prednisone, MMF) for inflammatory HP.
- Antifibrotics for fibrotic HP with progression.
