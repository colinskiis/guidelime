## Scope
2024 EASL clinical practice guideline on the diagnosis and management of portal hypertension in patients with cirrhosis.

## Key Recommendations

### Diagnosis and Risk Stratification
- **HVPG (Hepatic Venous Pressure Gradient)**: Gold standard. ≥10 mmHg = clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH).
- Non-invasive markers of CSPH: liver stiffness measurement (LSM), spleen stiffness, platelet count, MELD score.
- **Varices Screening**: EGD recommended at diagnosis of cirrhosis. Frequency of surveillance based on variceal findings and liver disease severity.

### Primary Prophylaxis (Prevention of First Variceal Bleed)

#### No Varices
- If CSPH present, consider non-selective beta-blocker (NSBB) – especially carvedilol – for prevention of varices development and decompensation (PREDESCI paradigm).

#### Small Varices
- NSBB (propranolol, nadolol, carvedilol) may be considered.

#### Medium/Large Varices
- **NSBB (Carvedilol 6.25-12.5 mg daily is preferred NSBB)** OR **endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL)**.
- Both are effective for primary prophylaxis; choice based on patient factors.

### Acute Variceal Bleeding
- Resuscitation, blood transfusion (target Hb 7-8 g/dL), IV terlipressin or octreotide/somatostatin.
- **Antibiotics**: Ceftriaxone 1 g/day x 7 days.
- **Emergent EGD** (<12 hours): EVL for esophageal varices.
- **TIPS**: Consider early TIPS (within 72 hours) for high-risk patients (Child-Pugh C 10-13 or Child-Pugh B with active bleeding at endoscopy).

### Secondary Prophylaxis (After Variceal Bleed)
- Combination of **NSBB + EVL** is standard.
- TIPS for refractory or recurrent bleeding.

### Ascites and SBP
- Addressed in separate hepatology guidelines; diuretics, paracentesis, TIPS for refractory ascites.
