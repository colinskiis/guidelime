## Scope
2024 AASLD guidance update on the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection.

## Key Recommendations

### Screening
- Screen high-risk populations: Persons born in endemic regions, PWID, HIV-positive, household/sexual contacts, hemodialysis, immunosuppressed.
- Universal HBsAg, anti-HBs, and anti-HBc testing recommended.

### Phases of Chronic HBV
- **Immune Tolerant**: High HBV DNA, normal ALT, minimal inflammation.
- **Immune Active (HBeAg+ or HBeAg-)**: Elevated ALT, high HBV DNA, inflammation/fibrosis.
- **Inactive Carrier**: Low/undetectable HBV DNA, normal ALT, HBsAg positive.
- **HBsAg-Negative (Resolved)**: Past infection, at risk of reactivation with immunosuppression.

### Indications for Treatment
- Immune active CHB (HBeAg+ or HBeAg-) with elevated ALT and/or significant fibrosis (F2+).
- Cirrhosis (compensated or decompensated) with any detectable HBV DNA.
- Prior to or during immunosuppressive therapy (prevent reactivation).
- Family history of HCC, extrahepatic manifestations.
- Consider in immune tolerant phase if age >40, elevated HBV DNA, or family history of HCC.

### Antiviral Therapy
- **First-Line Agents**:
  - **Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate (TDF)**: Preferred. High barrier to resistance.
  - **Tenofovir Alafenamide (TAF)**: Bone/renal-sparing, similar efficacy.
  - **Entecavir (ETV)**: Preferred alternative. High barrier to resistance.
- Treatment is typically long-term/indefinite.
- Pegylated interferon-alpha may be considered in select patients (finite duration, HBeAg seroconversion potential).

### HCC Surveillance
- Every 6 months with ultrasound ± AFP for:
  - All patients with cirrhosis.
  - Asian males ≥40, Asian females ≥50, African patients ≥20.
  - Family history of HCC.

### Monitoring
- HBV DNA, ALT every 3-6 months on treatment.
- HBsAg quantification may guide treatment duration in select patients.
