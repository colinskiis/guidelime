## Scope
Evidence-based recommendations for testing, managing, and treating hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, including simplified treatment approaches.

## Key Recommendations

### Screening and Testing

#### Universal Screening (Strong)
- One-time HCV screening for all adults ≥18 years
- Screen all pregnant persons each pregnancy
- Screen persons who inject drugs (at least annually)

#### Testing Approach
1. HCV antibody test (anti-HCV)
2. If positive: HCV RNA to confirm active infection
3. If RNA positive: Proceed to treatment evaluation

#### Linkage to Care
- Confirm RNA positivity
- Assess for cirrhosis
- Evaluate for prior treatment history

### Treatment Goals
- **Sustained virologic response (SVR)**: Undetectable HCV RNA 12 weeks post-treatment
- SVR = cure (>95% success with current regimens)

### Simplified Treatment Approach

#### Eligibility for Simplified Treatment
- Treatment-naive
- No cirrhosis OR compensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh A)
- No HBV coinfection
- Not pregnant

#### Simplified Regimens (Pangenotypic)
| Regimen | Duration |
|---------|----------|
| Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir (Mavyret) | 8 weeks |
| Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir (Epclusa) | 12 weeks |

#### Dosing
- **Glecaprevir 300 mg/Pibrentasvir 120 mg** once daily with food
- **Sofosbuvir 400 mg/Velpatasvir 100 mg** once daily with or without food

#### Minimal Monitoring
- Baseline: Confirm HCV RNA positive, assess for cirrhosis
- On-treatment: Not routinely required
- Post-treatment: SVR12 (HCV RNA 12 weeks after completion)

### Treatment of Specific Populations

#### Decompensated Cirrhosis (Child-Pugh B/C)
- Regimens containing NS3/4A protease inhibitors contraindicated
- Use Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir ± Ribavirin for 12-24 weeks
- Refer to hepatologist/transplant center

#### Chronic Kidney Disease (eGFR <30)
- Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir preferred
- Sofosbuvir-containing regimens approved but monitor closely

#### HBV Coinfection
- Test all patients for HBsAg, anti-HBc, anti-HBs
- Risk of HBV reactivation during/after HCV treatment
- Monitor HBV DNA if HBsAg positive

#### HIV Coinfection
- Check for drug-drug interactions with ART
- May require regimen adjustment
- Similar SVR rates as monoinfection

#### Pregnancy
- Treatment during pregnancy not currently recommended
- Treat before pregnancy if possible
- Mother-to-child transmission ~5.8%

### Retreatment After Failure

#### Prior DAA Failure
- Genotype and resistance testing recommended
- Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir/Voxilaprevir (Vosevi) for 12 weeks
- May need extended duration or ribavirin

### Special Considerations

#### Drug-Drug Interactions
- Check interactions before starting (www.hep-druginteractions.org)
- Common interactions: PPIs, statins, certain HIV medications, amiodarone

#### Adherence
- Treatment completion improves SVR
- Brief treatment courses (8-12 weeks) aid adherence
- Address barriers (transportation, substance use, housing)

### Post-SVR Management

#### Ongoing Cirrhosis Surveillance
- Continue HCC surveillance every 6 months (ultrasound ± AFP)
- Continue endoscopic variceal surveillance

#### Reinfection Monitoring
- Annual HCV RNA for persons at ongoing risk
- Counsel on risk reduction
- Retreatment if reinfected

### Public Health Considerations
- Curative treatment reduces transmission
- Treat all persons with HCV regardless of fibrosis stage
- Point-of-care testing improves linkage to care
