## Scope

This practice guidance provides updated recommendations for the evaluation and management of metabolic fatty liver disease, emphasizing non-invasive assessment and emerging pharmacotherapies.

## Key Recommendations

### Diagnosis
- Imaging: Ultrasound, CT, or MRI for steatosis detection
- Controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) for steatosis quantification
- MRI-PDFF for clinical trials and monitoring

### Noninvasive Fibrosis Assessment
- FIB-4 as initial screening tool
- Transient elastography for fibrosis staging
- Enhanced Liver Fibrosis (ELF) test as alternative
- Serial monitoring for disease progression

### Lifestyle Management
- Caloric restriction for weight loss
- Mediterranean diet pattern
- Regular physical activity (150+ min/week moderate exercise)
- Limit alcohol and fructose intake

### Pharmacologic Options
- Thyroid hormone receptor agonists for advanced fibrosis
- GLP-1 receptor agonists for dual metabolic benefit
- SGLT2 inhibitors may provide hepatic benefits
- Avoid hepatotoxic medications

### Bariatric Surgery
- Consider in severe obesity with MASH
- Significant histological improvement post-surgery
- Long-term metabolic benefits

### Monitoring
- Repeat noninvasive testing every 1-2 years
- More frequent monitoring in advanced fibrosis
- HCC surveillance per established guidelines
