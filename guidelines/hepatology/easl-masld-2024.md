## Scope
Updated 2024 joint European guideline for the diagnosis and management of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), the new terminology for NAFLD/NASH.

## Key Recommendations

### Nomenclature
- **MASLD** (Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease) replaces NAFLD.
- **MASH** (Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatohepatitis) replaces NASH.

### Screening and Diagnosis
- **At-Risk Populations**: Screen for MASLD in patients with obesity, type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and elevated liver enzymes.
- **FIB-4 Score**: Use the FIB-4 score as an initial, non-invasive assessment for liver fibrosis.
  - FIB-4 <1.30: Low risk, routine follow-up.
  - FIB-4 ≥1.30: Proceed to further evaluation (e.g., elastography, ELF, etc.).
- **Liver Stiffness Measurement (LSM)**: Vibration-controlled transient elastography (FibroScan) is recommended for assessment of fibrosis stage.

### Lifestyle Modification (Cornerstone of Therapy)
- **Weight Loss**: A sustained weight loss of ≥7-10% of body weight is the primary goal and is effective in resolving MASH and improving fibrosis.
- **Diet**: Mediterranean diet is recommended.
- **Physical Activity**: At least 150-300 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise per week.

### Pharmacotherapy
- **Resmetirom (Rezdiffra)**: The first FDA-approved medication for MASH with moderate-to-advanced fibrosis (F2-F3). A thyroid hormone receptor-beta agonist.
- **GLP-1 Receptor Agonists (e.g., Semaglutide)**: Recommended for weight loss and may have direct hepatic benefits; studies ongoing.
- **Pioglitazone**: May be considered for biopsy-proven MASH, especially in patients with T2D, though limited by side effects.
- **Vitamin E**: May be considered for non-diabetic patients with biopsy-proven MASH, but long-term safety is uncertain.

### Cardiovascular Risk
- Aggressively manage cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes), as CVD is the leading cause of death in MASLD patients.

### Liver Transplantation
- MASH (NASH) is a leading indication for liver transplantation. Patients with decompensated cirrhosis should be referred for transplant evaluation.
