## Scope
Evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis and management of Wilson's disease, a rare inherited disorder of copper metabolism.

## Key Recommendations

### Clinical Presentation

#### Hepatic Manifestations
- Asymptomatic liver enzyme elevation
- Chronic hepatitis
- Cirrhosis
- Acute liver failure

#### Neurologic Manifestations
- Movement disorders (tremor, dystonia, chorea)
- Dysarthria
- Dysphagia
- Parkinsonism
- Psychiatric symptoms

#### Other Manifestations
- Kayser-Fleischer rings (corneal copper deposition)
- Hemolytic anemia (Coombs-negative)
- Renal tubular dysfunction
- Cardiomyopathy
- Arthropathy

### Diagnosis

#### When to Suspect Wilson's Disease
- Unexplained liver disease in patients <40 years
- Neuropsychiatric symptoms in young adults
- Kayser-Fleischer rings
- Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia
- Family history

#### Diagnostic Tests
| Test | Findings in Wilson's Disease |
|------|------------------------------|
| Serum ceruloplasmin | Usually <20 mg/dL |
| 24-hour urine copper | >100 μg/24h (often >40 μg) |
| Serum copper | Low total; elevated free copper |
| Hepatic copper | >250 μg/g dry weight |
| Kayser-Fleischer rings | Present in most neurologic cases |

#### Leipzig Scoring System
- Combines clinical and laboratory findings
- Score ≥4: Diagnosis established
- Score 3: Possible, further testing needed
- Score ≤2: Unlikely

#### Genetic Testing
- ATP7B gene mutations
- Confirms diagnosis
- Family screening
- Prenatal diagnosis possible

### Treatment

#### Goals
- Reduce copper accumulation
- Prevent disease progression
- Improve symptoms

#### Chelation Therapy

##### D-Penicillamine
| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Mechanism | Copper chelation and urinary excretion |
| Dose | 750-1500 mg/day in divided doses |
| Side effects | Hypersensitivity, nephrotoxicity, bone marrow suppression |
| Monitoring | CBC, urinalysis, renal function |

##### Trientine
| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Mechanism | Copper chelation |
| Dose | 750-1500 mg/day in divided doses |
| Side effects | Generally better tolerated than D-penicillamine |
| Use | First-line or D-penicillamine intolerance |

#### Zinc Therapy

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Mechanism | Blocks intestinal copper absorption |
| Dose | 150 mg elemental zinc/day in divided doses |
| Use | Maintenance therapy, presymptomatic patients |
| Side effects | GI upset |

#### Treatment Selection
| Situation | Preferred Treatment |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Symptomatic hepatic | Chelation therapy |
| Symptomatic neurologic | Chelation (trientine preferred) |
| Presymptomatic | Zinc or low-dose chelation |
| Maintenance | Zinc or continued chelation |
| Pregnancy | Zinc or low-dose chelation |

### Liver Transplantation

#### Indications
- Acute liver failure
- Decompensated cirrhosis unresponsive to treatment
- MELD score consideration

#### Outcomes
- Curative for hepatic disease
- May improve neurologic symptoms
- Corrects metabolic defect

### Monitoring

#### During Treatment
| Parameter | Frequency |
|-----------|-----------|
| 24-hour urine copper | Every 3-6 months initially |
| Liver function tests | Every 3-6 months |
| CBC | Every 3-6 months |
| Neurologic assessment | Regular |

#### Treatment Goals
- 24-hour urine copper: 200-500 μg (on chelation)
- Non-ceruloplasmin-bound copper normalization
- Clinical stability or improvement

### Family Screening

#### Recommendation
- Screen all first-degree relatives
- ATP7B genetic testing
- Biochemical testing

#### Presymptomatic Treatment
- Early treatment prevents disease manifestations
- Zinc or low-dose chelation

### Diet

- Avoid high-copper foods (liver, shellfish, chocolate, nuts, mushrooms)
- Especially important during initial treatment
- Less restrictive once controlled

### Pregnancy

- Continue treatment (risk of deterioration if stopped)
- Zinc preferred
- Reduce chelation dose
- Close monitoring

### Neurologic Worsening

- May occur early in treatment
- More common with D-penicillamine
- Consider switching to trientine or zinc
- Usually reversible

### Long-Term Management

- Lifelong treatment required
- Regular monitoring
- Compliance essential
- Multidisciplinary care (hepatology, neurology)
