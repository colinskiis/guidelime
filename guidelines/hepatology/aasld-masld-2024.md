## Scope
Comprehensive 2024 AASLD practice guidance for the assessment and management of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH).

## Key Recommendations

### Diagnosis and Risk Stratification
- **Who to Screen**: Adults with T2D, obesity (BMI ≥30), metabolic syndrome, or incidentally detected hepatic steatosis.
- **Non-Invasive Tests (NITs)**: Use a sequential approach.
  1. **FIB-4**: First-line screen for fibrosis risk.
  2. **Liver Stiffness Measurement (LSM) or ELF**: For those with intermediate FIB-4 (1.3-2.67) or high risk.
- **Liver Biopsy**: Consider when diagnosis is uncertain, for clinical trials, or when it will change management.

### Lifestyle Intervention
- **Weight Loss**: The most effective intervention. Target ≥5% for steatosis improvement, ≥7-10% for MASH resolution, and ≥10% for fibrosis improvement.
- **Diet**: Caloric restriction and Mediterranean-style diet.
- **Exercise**: Independent benefit for hepatic fat reduction even without significant weight loss.

### Pharmacotherapy
- **Resmetirom (Rezdiffra)**: Recommended for adult patients with non-cirrhotic MASH and moderate-to-advanced fibrosis (F2-F3).
- **GLP-1 RAs (Semaglutide)**: Effective for weight loss and may improve hepatic histology; commonly used off-label for MASLD with obesity/T2D.
- **Pioglitazone**: May be used for biopsy-proven MASH, particularly in patients with T2D.
- **Vitamin E (800 IU/day)**: May be considered for non-diabetic adults with biopsy-proven MASH.

### Metabolic Surgery
- Bariatric/metabolic surgery is effective for sustained weight loss and MASH improvement in patients with obesity who meet surgical criteria.

### Management of Comorbidities
- Optimal control of diabetes (consider SGLT2 inhibitors, GLP-1 RAs), dyslipidemia (statins are safe and indicated), and hypertension.

### Surveillance
- Monitor for disease progression, HCC in cirrhotic patients, and decompensation.
