## Scope
2024 AASLD practice guidance on the diagnosis and management of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD, formerly NAFLD) and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH, formerly NASH).

## Key Recommendations

### Definition (New Nomenclature 2023)
- **MASLD**: Steatotic liver disease (SLD) with ≥1 cardiometabolic risk factor (overweight/obesity, T2DM, metabolic syndrome criteria).
- **MASH**: MASLD with steatohepatitis (hepatocyte ballooning, inflammation) ± fibrosis.
- Replaces NAFLD/NASH terminology.

### Diagnosis
- **Imaging**: Ultrasound (steatosis), vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE/FibroScan) for steatosis (CAP) and fibrosis (kPa).
- **Fibrosis Assessment**: Non-invasive fibrosis scores (FIB-4, NFS) to identify patients at risk. VCTE, ELF, MRE for further risk stratification.
- **Liver Biopsy**: Gold standard for diagnosing MASH and staging fibrosis; reserve for unclear cases or clinical trial eligibility.

### Risk Stratification
- Patients with advanced fibrosis (F3-F4) are at highest risk for liver-related morbidity and mortality.

### Management

#### Lifestyle Intervention (Cornerstone)
- **Weight Loss**: ≥7-10% body weight loss improves steatohepatitis and fibrosis. Diet (caloric restriction) + exercise.
- **Avoid Alcohol Excess**.

#### Pharmacotherapy
- **Resmetirom (Rezdiffra)**: FDA-approved (2024) for MASH with moderate-to-advanced fibrosis (F2-F3). Thyroid hormone receptor beta agonist. Improves fibrosis and NASH resolution.
- **GLP-1 Receptor Agonists (Semaglutide)**: Off-label but strong evidence for histologic improvement in MASH. Also addresses metabolic comorbidities (diabetes, obesity).
- **Pioglitazone**: May improve histology in MASH; consider in patients with T2DM.
- **Vitamin E (800 IU/day)**: May improve histology in non-diabetic MASH; long-term safety uncertain.

#### Cardiovascular Risk Management
- MASLD is associated with high CV risk. Aggressive management of dyslipidemia, hypertension, diabetes.

### Monitoring
- Regular fibrosis assessment (every 1-2 years if at-risk).
- HCC surveillance for patients with cirrhosis (ultrasound ± AFP every 6 months).
