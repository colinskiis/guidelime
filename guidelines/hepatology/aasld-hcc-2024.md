## Scope
Comprehensive 2024 AASLD guidance on the prevention, surveillance, diagnosis, and treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

## Key Recommendations

### Surveillance
- **Who**: Adults with cirrhosis (any etiology), chronic HBV with high fibrosis risk, advanced MASLD/MASH without cirrhosis (may consider).
- **How**: Ultrasound ± alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) every 6 months.
- **Abbreviated MRI**: May be considered as an alternative in patients with obesity or poor ultrasound visualization.

### Diagnosis
- **LI-RADS**: Use CT or MRI with liver-specific contrast; LI-RADS 5 (definite HCC) criteria include arterial phase hyperenhancement and "washout" on portal venous or delayed phase.
- **Biopsy**: Reserved for indeterminate lesions.

### Staging
- Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging system guides treatment decisions.

### Treatment
- **Very Early/Early Stage (BCLC 0/A)**: Curative options – surgical resection, liver transplant, or ablation.
- **Intermediate Stage (BCLC B)**: Locoregional therapy (TACE, TARE).
- **Advanced Stage (BCLC C)**: Systemic therapy.
  - **First-Line**: Atezolizumab + bevacizumab (preferred). Alternatives: durvalumab + tremelimumab, sorafenib, lenvatinib.
  - **Second-Line**: Regorafenib, cabozantinib, ramucirumab (if AFP ≥400).
- **Terminal Stage (BCLC D)**: Best supportive care.

### Prevention
- Antiviral therapy for HBV/HCV reduces HCC risk.
- MASLD management with lifestyle and emerging pharmacotherapies.
