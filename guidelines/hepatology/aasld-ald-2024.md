## Scope
2024 AASLD guidance on the diagnosis and management of alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD), including alcohol-associated hepatitis.

## Key Recommendations

### Diagnosis
- ALD encompasses steatosis, steatohepatitis, fibrosis/cirrhosis due to heavy alcohol use (typically >40 g/day in men, >20 g/day in women for >5 years).
- **Alcohol-Associated Hepatitis (AH)**: Clinical syndrome with rapid onset of jaundice, elevated bilirubin, AST > ALT (ratio >1.5), recent heavy alcohol use, and absence of other liver disease causes.

### Severity Assessment
- **Maddrey Discriminant Function (MDF)**: MDF ≥32 indicates severe AH.
- **MELD Score**: Higher MELD correlates with worse prognosis.
- **Lille Score**: Used at day 7 on steroids to determine response.

### Management of Alcohol-Associated Hepatitis

#### Alcohol Cessation
- Cornerstone of treatment for all ALD. Refer to addiction medicine, behavioral therapy, and/or medications (naltrexone, acamprosate, baclofen—though data in ALD are limited).

#### Nutritional Support
- Patients with AH are often malnourished. Provide adequate protein (1.2-1.5 g/kg/day) and calories.

#### Corticosteroids (Severe AH: MDF ≥32)
- **Prednisolone 40 mg/day x 28 days**: Consider for severe AH without contraindications (active infection, GI bleeding, renal failure).
- Assess response at day 7 with Lille score. If non-responder, discontinue steroids.

#### Other Pharmacotherapies
- Pentoxifylline no longer recommended (STOPAH trial).
- N-acetylcysteine: May be used as adjunct to corticosteroids but is not a standalone therapy.

### Liver Transplantation
- Consider early liver transplant for select patients with severe AH who do not respond to medical therapy, are psychosocially stable, and have a strong support system for abstinence.

### Cirrhosis Management
- Standard cirrhosis care: Variceal screening, HCC surveillance, diuretics for ascites, etc.
