## Scope
2024 AAD clinical practice guideline on the management of alopecia areata (AA) in adults and children.

## Key Recommendations

### General Approach
- Assess extent of hair loss (patchy, totalis, universalis) and psychosocial impact.
- Spontaneous remission occurs in ~50% of patients with limited patchy AA within 1 year, but relapse is common.

### Topical/Intralesional Therapies (Limited Disease)

#### Intralesional Corticosteroids
- **First-line for patchy AA**: Triamcinolone acetonide (2.5-10 mg/mL) injected into affected scalp every 4-6 weeks.

#### Topical Corticosteroids
- High-potency topical steroids (clobetasol) may be used, especially in children or those averse to injections.

#### Topical Immunotherapy
- Contact sensitizers (DPCP, SADBE) induce allergic contact dermatitis to stimulate regrowth. Effective in some patients with extensive disease.

#### Topical Minoxidil
- Adjunctive therapy to enhance regrowth; limited efficacy as monotherapy.

### Systemic Therapies (Extensive or Refractory Disease)

#### JAK Inhibitors (FDA-Approved)
- **Baricitinib (Olumiant)**: JAK1/2 inhibitor. Approved for severe AA in adults.
- **Ritlecitinib (Litfulo)**: JAK3/TEC inhibitor. Approved for AA in patients ≥12 years.
- Highly effective; regrowth seen in significant proportion of patients.
- Monitor for infections, lipid abnormalities, VTE risk.

#### Off-Label Systemic Options
- Oral corticosteroids (short-term pulse therapy).
- Methotrexate, cyclosporine: May be considered for refractory cases.

### Patient Counseling
- Psychological support, referral to support groups.
- Wigs, scarves, cosmetic camouflage.
- Discuss realistic expectations and potential for relapse.
