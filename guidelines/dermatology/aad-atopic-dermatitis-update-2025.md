## Scope
Focused update to the AAD clinical guidelines for atopic dermatitis, incorporating late-2024 and early-2025 evidence for new pharmacological interventions in adults.

## Key Recommendations

### New Topical Therapies (Non-steroidal)
- **Tapinarof Cream (1%)**: Strong recommendation for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in adults. It is an aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) agonist.
- **Roflumilast Cream (0.15%)**: Strong recommendation for use in adults and children (≥6 years) with atopic dermatitis. It is a potent PDE4 inhibitor with favorable local tolerability.

### New Systemic Biologics
- **Lebrikizumab**: Strong recommendation for adults and adolescents (≥12 years) with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis that is not adequately controlled with topical therapies. It targets IL-13 with high affinity.
- **Nemolizumab**: Recommended for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in adults, specifically for those with significant pruritus. It is an IL-31 receptor alpha antagonist.

### Integration with Existing Therapy
- **Topical Corticosteroids (TCS)**: Remain the mainstay of initial therapy for flare management.
- **Steroid Sparing**: The new topical agents (tapinarof, roflumilast) should be considered to reduce the long-term burden of TCS and avoid skin atrophy.
- **Systemic Choice**: Choice between lebrikizumab, dupilumab, or JAK inhibitors should be based on patient preference, speed of onset required (JAK inhibitors faster), and safety profile (biologics generally preferred for long-term safety).

### Safety and Monitoring
- **JAK Inhibitors**: Monitoring for VTE, serious infections, and laboratory abnormalities (CBC, lipids) remains mandatory.
- **Biologics**: Generally do not require routine laboratory monitoring.
- **Topicals**: Monitor for local application site reactions (e.g., folliculitis with tapinarof).
