## Scope

This updated guideline provides recommendations for the use of biologic therapies in the management of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults.

## Key Recommendations

### When to Consider Biologics
- Moderate to severe psoriasis (BSA >3-10% or DLQI impacted)
- Inadequate response to topical therapy
- Inadequate response or intolerance to conventional systemic therapy
- Concomitant psoriatic arthritis

### IL-23 Inhibitors (Highest Efficacy)
**First-Line Options:**
- Risankizumab 150mg SC at weeks 0, 4, then q12 weeks
- Guselkumab 100mg SC at weeks 0, 4, then q8 weeks
- Tildrakizumab 100mg SC at weeks 0, 4, then q12 weeks

### IL-17 Inhibitors
- Secukinumab 300mg SC loading, then monthly
- Ixekizumab 160mg then 80mg q2 weeks x5, then monthly
- Brodalumab 210mg SC at weeks 0, 1, 2, then q2 weeks
- Bimekizumab 320mg at weeks 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, then q8 weeks (highest PASI 100 rates)

### TNF Inhibitors
- Adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab, certolizumab pegol
- Consider if concurrent psoriatic arthritis, IBD, uveitis
- Generally lower efficacy for skin than IL-17/IL-23 inhibitors

### IL-12/23 Inhibitor
- Ustekinumab 45mg (<100kg) or 90mg (>100kg) at weeks 0, 4, then q12 weeks
- Established safety profile

### Treatment Selection
- IL-23 and IL-17 inhibitors generally preferred for skin disease
- Consider comorbidities (IBD: avoid IL-17; joint disease: TNFi or IL-17)
- Cardiovascular risk: Most biologics have favorable profile

### Biosimilars
- Approved biosimilars available for adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab
- Appropriate for new starts or stable switches
- Monitor after switching

### Monitoring
- TB screening before initiation
- Hepatitis B/C screening
- No routine laboratory monitoring for IL-23 inhibitors
- Clinical response assessment at 12-16 weeks
