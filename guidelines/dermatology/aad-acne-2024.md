## Scope
2024 AAD clinical practice guideline on the management of acne vulgaris in adolescents and adults.

## Key Recommendations

### Classification
- **Comedonal Acne**: Non-inflammatory; open/closed comedones.
- **Inflammatory Acne**: Papules, pustules, nodules, cysts.
- Severity: Mild, moderate, severe.

### Topical Therapy (First-Line for Mild-Moderate Acne)

#### Retinoids
- **Tretinoin, Adapalene, Tazarotene, Trifarotene**: Core of acne therapy. Prevents comedones, has anti-inflammatory effect.
- Adapalene 0.1% is OTC.

#### Benzoyl Peroxide (BPO)
- Kills P. acnes, reduces resistance to antibiotics when combined.
- Use in combination with topical retinoid and/or topical antibiotic.

#### Topical Antibiotics
- **Clindamycin, Erythromycin**: Should NOT be used as monotherapy due to resistance. Always combine with BPO.

#### Fixed-Dose Combinations
- Adapalene + BPO, clindamycin + BPO, tretinoin + clindamycin.

### Systemic Therapy (Moderate-Severe or Refractory Acne)

#### Oral Antibiotics
- **Doxycycline, Minocycline, Sarecycline**: Use for limited duration (3-4 months) with topical retinoid ± BPO.
- Avoid long-term use to reduce antibiotic resistance.

#### Hormonal Therapy (Females)
- **Combined Oral Contraceptives**: FDA-approved options for acne.
- **Spironolactone**: Off-label but widely used for hormonal acne.

#### Isotretinoin
- Highly effective for severe, nodular/cystic, or treatment-resistant acne.
- iPLEDGE program required due to teratogenicity.
- Monitor lipids, LFTs, CBC.
- Many patients achieve durable remission.

### Adjunctive Therapies
- Chemical peels, comedone extraction, intralesional corticosteroids for cysts.

### Scarring
- Early, aggressive treatment prevents scarring.
- Post-acne scarring can be addressed with lasers, microneedling, fillers, subcision.
