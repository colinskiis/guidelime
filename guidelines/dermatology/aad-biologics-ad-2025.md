## Scope
2025 focused update to AAD guidelines for the management of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD) in adults with systemic and biologic therapies.

## Key Recommendations

### Biologic Therapies (Strong Recommendations)
- **Dupilumab (Dupixent)**: IL-4/IL-13 blocker. First-line biologic for moderate-to-severe AD. Proven efficacy and safety.
- **Tralokinumab (Adbry)**: IL-13 blocker. Alternative for patients who prefer or require an IL-13-specific agent.
- **Lebrikizumab (Ebglyss)**: IL-13 blocker. FDA approved 2024. Strong recommendation for adults with moderate-to-severe AD.
- **Nemolizumab**: IL-31 receptor antagonist. FDA approved 2024. Particularly effective for pruritus. Recommended for use with concomitant topical corticosteroids.

### JAK Inhibitors (Conditional Recommendations)
- **Upadacitinib (Rinvoq)**: Oral JAK1 inhibitor. Highly effective. Consider cardiovascular, thromboembolic, and malignancy risk (boxed warning).
- **Abrocitinib (Cibinqo)**: Oral JAK1 inhibitor. Similar efficacy profile to upadacitinib.
- Baseline labs and ongoing monitoring (CBC, lipids, hepatic function) recommended.

### Traditional Systemic Agents
- **Cyclosporine, Methotrexate, Azathioprine, Mycophenolate**: May still be used when biologics/JAKi are contraindicated or unavailable. Less evidence-based.

### Treatment Selection Considerations
- Base choice on efficacy, safety profile, patient preference, comorbidities (e.g., avoid JAKi in patients with CV risk factors), and prior treatment response.
- Combination with topical therapy (especially TCS) often enhances outcomes.
