## Scope
Evidence-based recommendations for the use of biologic therapies in the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in adults.

## Key Recommendations

### Indications for Biologics
- Moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis
- Inadequate response to topical therapy
- Inadequate response to phototherapy or systemic agents
- Significant impact on quality of life

### TNF-alpha Inhibitors

#### Adalimumab
- Loading: 80 mg SC, then 40 mg at week 1
- Maintenance: 40 mg SC every 2 weeks
- Monitor for TB, hepatitis B reactivation

#### Etanercept
- 50 mg SC twice weekly for 12 weeks
- Maintenance: 50 mg SC once weekly
- Less efficacious than other biologics

#### Infliximab
- 5 mg/kg IV at weeks 0, 2, 6
- Maintenance: 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks
- Rapid onset of action

#### Certolizumab Pegol
- Loading: 400 mg SC at weeks 0, 2, 4
- Maintenance: 200 mg every 2 weeks (or 400 mg every 4 weeks)
- Minimal placental transfer; option in pregnancy

### IL-17 Inhibitors

#### Secukinumab
- Loading: 300 mg SC weekly for 5 weeks
- Maintenance: 300 mg every 4 weeks
- High efficacy (PASI 90 response ~70%)

#### Ixekizumab
- Loading: 160 mg SC, then 80 mg at weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12
- Maintenance: 80 mg every 4 weeks
- Very high PASI 90 response rates

#### Brodalumab
- 210 mg SC at weeks 0, 1, 2
- Maintenance: 210 mg every 2 weeks
- Black box warning for suicidal ideation

### IL-12/23 Inhibitors

#### Ustekinumab
- Weight-based dosing: <100 kg: 45 mg; ≥100 kg: 90 mg
- Weeks 0, 4, then every 12 weeks
- Durable response with infrequent dosing

### IL-23 Inhibitors

#### Guselkumab
- 100 mg SC at weeks 0 and 4
- Maintenance: 100 mg every 8 weeks
- Selective IL-23p19 inhibitor

#### Tildrakizumab
- 100 mg SC at weeks 0 and 4
- Maintenance: 100 mg every 12 weeks

#### Risankizumab
- 150 mg SC at weeks 0 and 4
- Maintenance: 150 mg every 12 weeks
- High PASI 90 and PASI 100 rates

### Pre-Treatment Screening
| Test | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| TB testing | Rule out latent TB before TNF inhibitors |
| Hepatitis B/C | Risk of reactivation |
| CBC | Baseline monitoring |
| LFTs | Hepatotoxicity screening |
| Pregnancy test | Many biologics contraindicated |

### Safety Considerations
- Serious infections: Monitor and hold during active infection
- Malignancy: Theoretical risk; monitor for skin cancers
- Heart failure: Avoid TNF inhibitors in moderate-severe CHF
- Demyelinating disease: Avoid TNF inhibitors
- Vaccinations: Update before starting; avoid live vaccines

### Monitoring
- Clinical response assessment at 12-16 weeks
- Routine labs per individual drug recommendations
- TB screening annually if ongoing risk
- Skin cancer surveillance

### Combination Therapy
- May combine with methotrexate to reduce immunogenicity
- May add topical therapy for residual lesions
- Phototherapy generally not combined
