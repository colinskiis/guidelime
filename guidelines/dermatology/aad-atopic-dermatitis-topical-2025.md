## Scope
2025 focused update to AAD guidelines for the management of atopic dermatitis (AD) in adults, incorporating novel topical therapies approved in 2024.

## Key Recommendations

### New Topical Therapies (Strong Recommendations)
- **Tapinarof 1% Cream (Vtama)**: An aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) modulating agent. Recommended for mild-to-moderate AD. Once-daily application, steroid-free.
- **Roflumilast 0.15% Cream (Zoryve)**: A PDE4 inhibitor. Recommended for mild-to-moderate AD. Once-daily, steroid-free option.

### Established Topical Therapies
- **Topical Corticosteroids (TCS)**: Remain the first-line treatment for AD flares. Choose potency based on body site, age, and disease severity.
- **Topical Calcineurin Inhibitors (TCIs: Tacrolimus, Pimecrolimus)**: Steroid-sparing options for maintenance or sensitive areas (face, intertriginous zones).
- **Crisaborole 2% Ointment**: A PDE4 inhibitor for mild-to-moderate AD; now with additional evidence for long-term use.

### Proactive Maintenance Therapy
- For patients with frequently relapsing AD, consider proactive application of TCS or TCI to previously affected areas 2-3 times per week.

### Combination Therapy
- Topical agents may be used in combination with systemic or biologic therapies for patients with moderate-to-severe AD.
