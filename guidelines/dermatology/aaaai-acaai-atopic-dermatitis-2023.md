## Scope
Evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis and management of atopic dermatitis (eczema) using GRADE methodology.

## Key Recommendations

### Diagnosis

#### Clinical Criteria
- Pruritus (essential feature)
- Eczematous morphology
- Chronic or relapsing course
- Age-typical distribution

#### Distribution by Age
| Age Group | Typical Distribution |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Infants | Face, scalp, extensor surfaces |
| Children | Flexural areas (antecubital, popliteal) |
| Adults | Hands, flexural areas, face/neck |

### General Management

#### Skin Care (Strong)
- Daily bathing followed by immediate moisturizer application
- Use fragrance-free moisturizers
- Avoid irritants (harsh soaps, wool, extremes of temperature)

#### Moisturizers
| Type | Recommendation |
|------|----------------|
| Ointments | Most occlusive; best for dry skin |
| Creams | Intermediate |
| Lotions | Least occlusive |

### Topical Therapies

#### Topical Corticosteroids (Strong)
- First-line anti-inflammatory therapy
- Potency matched to severity and location
- Use lowest effective potency

#### Potency Selection
| Location | Recommended Potency |
|----------|---------------------|
| Face, intertriginous | Low potency |
| Body | Medium potency |
| Thick plaques, palms/soles | High potency |

#### Topical Calcineurin Inhibitors (Strong)
- Tacrolimus 0.03% or 0.1%
- Pimecrolimus 1%
- Steroid-sparing for face, intertriginous areas
- Can use for maintenance

#### Newer Topical Agents
| Agent | Mechanism | Notes |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| Crisaborole | PDE4 inhibitor | Mild-moderate AD |
| Ruxolitinib | JAK inhibitor | Moderate-severe AD |
| Tapinarof | AhR modulator | AD treatment |
| Roflumilast | PDE4 inhibitor | AD treatment |

### Systemic Therapies

#### Dupilumab (Strong)
- IL-4/IL-13 inhibitor
- First-line systemic for moderate-severe AD
- Adults and children ≥6 months
- 300 mg (adults) SC every 2 weeks

#### JAK Inhibitors
| Agent | Dose | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| Abrocitinib | 100-200 mg daily | Oral JAK1 inhibitor |
| Upadacitinib | 15-30 mg daily | Oral JAK inhibitor |
| Baricitinib | 2-4 mg daily | Oral JAK1/2 inhibitor |

#### Other Biologics
| Agent | Mechanism | Notes |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| Tralokinumab | IL-13 inhibitor | Adults with moderate-severe AD |
| Lebrikizumab | IL-13 inhibitor | Adults and adolescents |
| Nemolizumab | IL-31 inhibitor | Targets pruritus |

#### Traditional Systemic Agents
| Agent | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| Cyclosporine | Effective but limited by toxicity |
| Methotrexate | Less evidence than biologics |
| Azathioprine | Alternative option |
| Mycophenolate | Off-label use |

### Management of Pruritus

#### Antihistamines
- Sedating antihistamines (hydroxyzine, diphenhydramine) may help sleep
- Limited evidence for itch reduction
- Non-sedating antihistamines for allergic comorbidities

#### Other Approaches
- Wet wrap therapy
- Cooling measures
- Distraction techniques
- Treat underlying inflammation

### Infection Management

#### Staphylococcus aureus Colonization
- Very common in AD
- Dilute bleach baths may help (conditional)
- Systemic antibiotics only for clinical infection

#### Eczema Herpeticum
- Antiviral therapy (acyclovir/valacyclovir)
- May require hospitalization

### Trigger Avoidance

#### Environmental
- Avoid irritants
- Temperature and humidity control
- Consider dust mite reduction

#### Allergens
- Food allergy testing if suspected
- Aeroallergen sensitization may contribute

### Food Allergy and AD

#### Testing Recommendations
- Test if history suggests food-triggered flares
- Do not routinely eliminate foods without evidence
- Consider evaluation for egg, milk, peanut, wheat, soy

### Phototherapy

#### Indications
- Moderate-severe AD unresponsive to topical therapy
- Narrowband UVB preferred

### Monitoring
- Regular assessment of disease severity (EASI, IGA, SCORAD)
- Quality of life assessment
- Monitor for treatment side effects

### Special Populations

#### Pregnancy
- Continue emollients
- Low-potency topical steroids safe
- Dupilumab: limited data but no signal of harm

#### Children
- Many treatments approved for pediatric use
- Age-appropriate dosing
- Family education essential
