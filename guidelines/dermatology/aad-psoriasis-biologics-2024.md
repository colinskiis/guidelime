## Scope
2024 AAD guideline update on the use of biologic therapies for the management of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.

## Key Recommendations

### IL-23 Inhibitors (Preferred)
- **Guselkumab (Tremfya)**, **Risankizumab (Skyrizi)**, **Tildrakizumab (Ilumya)**: Target IL-23p19.
- High efficacy (PASI 90/100 responses), favorable safety profile, convenient dosing (every 8-12 weeks after loading).
- Strong recommendation as first-line biologic for most patients.

### IL-17 Inhibitors
- **Secukinumab (Cosentyx)**, **Ixekizumab (Taltz)**, **Brodalumab (Siliq)**, **Bimekizumab (Bimzelx)**: Target IL-17A (and IL-17F for bimekizumab).
- Very rapid and high efficacy. Particularly useful for nail and palmoplantar psoriasis.
- Strong recommendation.
- Caution: Associated with increased risk of Candida infections.

### TNF-α Inhibitors
- **Adalimumab (Humira/biosimilars)**, **Infliximab (Remicade/biosimilars)**, **Etanercept (Enbrel/biosimilars)**, **Certolizumab (Cimzia)**.
- Effective for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Longer track record.
- Generally considered second-line to IL-23 and IL-17 inhibitors due to comparatively lower skin clearance.

### IL-12/23 Inhibitor
- **Ustekinumab (Stelara)**: Targets IL-12 and IL-23 (p40 subunit). Effective with long dosing interval. Good long-term safety data.

### Special Considerations
- **Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA)**: IL-17 inhibitors and TNF inhibitors are preferred for concurrent PsA.
- **IBD**: Avoid IL-17 inhibitors in patients with active IBD (can exacerbate); prefer IL-23 or TNF inhibitors.
- **Screening**: TB screening, hepatitis B/C testing before biologic initiation. Avoid live vaccines during therapy.

### Treatment Goals
- Target PASI 90 or clear/almost clear skin. Treat to target.
