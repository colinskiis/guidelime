## Scope
First ASCRS clinical practice guideline specifically addressing prevention of surgical site infections in colorectal surgery.

## Key Recommendations

### Overview

#### Importance
| Factor | Details |
|--------|---------|
| SSI incidence | Higher in colorectal than other surgery |
| Morbidity | Significant patient impact |
| Cost | Substantial healthcare burden |
| Prevention | Multiple modifiable factors |

### Preoperative Measures

#### Patient Optimization
| Factor | Intervention |
|--------|--------------|
| Diabetes | Optimize glycemic control |
| Malnutrition | Nutritional supplementation |
| Smoking | Cessation recommended |
| Obesity | Consider weight optimization if time allows |
| Immunosuppression | Minimize if possible |

#### Mechanical Bowel Preparation
| Recommendation | Details |
|----------------|---------|
| MBP alone | Not recommended |
| MBP with oral antibiotics | Recommended for elective colorectal surgery |
| Oral antibiotics | Usually neomycin + metronidazole or erythromycin |
| Timing | Day before surgery |

#### Preoperative Bathing
| Recommendation | Details |
|----------------|---------|
| Antiseptic shower | Consider chlorhexidine |
| Timing | Night before and morning of surgery |
| Evidence | Limited but low risk |

#### Nasal Decolonization
| Recommendation | Details |
|----------------|---------|
| S. aureus screening | Consider for high-risk patients |
| Mupirocin | Nasal application for carriers |
| Chlorhexidine bathing | Often combined with mupirocin |

### Intraoperative Measures

#### Prophylactic Antibiotics
| Aspect | Recommendation |
|--------|----------------|
| Timing | Within 60 minutes before incision |
| Redosing | Per half-life during prolonged cases |
| Spectrum | Cover gram-negative and anaerobes |
| Duration | Discontinue within 24 hours |

#### Skin Preparation
| Recommendation | Details |
|----------------|---------|
| Agent | Chlorhexidine-alcohol preferred |
| Application | Allow to dry completely |
| Alternative | Povidone-iodine if CHG contraindicated |

#### Hair Removal
| Recommendation | Details |
|----------------|---------|
| If necessary | Use clippers, not razors |
| Timing | Immediately before surgery |
| Preference | Avoid removal if possible |

#### Normothermia
| Recommendation | Details |
|----------------|---------|
| Target | Core temperature ≥36°C |
| Methods | Forced-air warming, warm fluids |
| Monitoring | Continuous intraoperative |

#### Glycemic Control
| Target | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Blood glucose | <180-200 mg/dL |
| Protocol | Insulin infusion if needed |
| Monitoring | Intraoperative and postoperative |

#### Oxygen Supplementation
| Recommendation | Details |
|----------------|---------|
| FiO2 | High inspired oxygen (80%) may reduce SSI |
| Evidence | Mixed; consider for high-risk |
| Duration | Intraoperative and early postoperative |

#### Surgical Technique
| Practice | Details |
|----------|---------|
| Tissue handling | Minimize trauma |
| Hemostasis | Meticulous |
| Dead space | Minimize |
| Foreign material | Minimize sutures, mesh when possible |

#### Wound Protection
| Method | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Wound protectors | Recommended for open surgery |
| Glove change | Before closure |
| Separate instruments | For abdominal wall closure |

#### Incisional Wound Management
| Technique | Recommendation |
|-----------|----------------|
| Fascial closure | Monofilament suture preferred |
| Skin closure | Varies; subcuticular often used |
| Drains | Avoid routine use; case-by-case |

### Postoperative Measures

#### Wound Care
| Recommendation | Details |
|----------------|---------|
| Dressing removal | 24-48 hours if no issues |
| Showering | Usually permitted after 48 hours |
| Inspection | Daily for signs of infection |

#### Glycemic Control
- Continue perioperative glucose management
- Monitor regularly

### Bundles and Order Sets

#### Recommended Approach
| Strategy | Details |
|----------|---------|
| SSI bundles | Combine multiple interventions |
| Order sets | Standardize care |
| Compliance monitoring | Track adherence |
| Feedback | Provide to surgical team |

#### Bundle Components
- Oral antibiotics with MBP
- Preoperative CHG bathing
- Appropriate IV antibiotic timing
- Normothermia maintenance
- Glycemic control
- Wound protector use

### Special Populations

#### Emergency Surgery
| Consideration | Approach |
|---------------|----------|
| Limited optimization time | Focus on modifiable factors |
| MBP | Often not feasible |
| Antibiotics | Administer promptly |

#### Immunocompromised
- Higher SSI risk
- Optimize modifiable factors
- Close postoperative monitoring

### Monitoring and Quality Improvement

#### Surveillance
| Element | Details |
|---------|---------|
| SSI tracking | Required for quality reporting |
| Definitions | Use standardized criteria (CDC/NHSN) |
| 30-day monitoring | Standard surveillance period |
| Feedback loop | Report to surgical teams |
