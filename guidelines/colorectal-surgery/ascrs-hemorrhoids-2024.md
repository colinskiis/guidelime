## Scope
Evidence-based recommendations for the evaluation and management of hemorrhoidal disease.

## Key Recommendations

### Classification

#### Internal Hemorrhoids
| Grade | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Grade I | No prolapse; bleeding |
| Grade II | Prolapse with spontaneous reduction |
| Grade III | Prolapse requiring manual reduction |
| Grade IV | Prolapse that cannot be reduced |

#### External Hemorrhoids
- Located below dentate line
- Covered by anoderm
- May thrombose

### Initial Evaluation

#### History
| Component | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Symptoms | Bleeding, prolapse, pain, itching |
| Bowel habits | Constipation, straining, diarrhea |
| Duration | Acute vs chronic |
| Red flags | Weight loss, change in caliber, family history |

#### Physical Examination
| Element | Details |
|---------|---------|
| External inspection | Skin tags, prolapse, thrombosis |
| Digital rectal exam | Masses, sphincter tone |
| Anoscopy | Visualize internal hemorrhoids |

#### When to Consider Colonoscopy
- Age ≥45 (average risk screening)
- Rectal bleeding with concerning features
- Family history of colorectal cancer
- Iron deficiency anemia
- Change in bowel habits

### Conservative Management

#### First-Line for Grade I-II
| Intervention | Details |
|--------------|---------|
| Fiber supplementation | 25-35 g/day |
| Hydration | Adequate fluid intake |
| Avoid straining | Time limits on toilet |
| Sitz baths | Warm water, 10-15 min |
| Topical agents | Limited evidence for efficacy |

#### Lifestyle Modifications
- Regular exercise
- Avoid prolonged sitting
- Respond to urge to defecate
- Avoid excessive wiping

### Office-Based Procedures

#### Rubber Band Ligation
| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Indication | Grade I-III internal hemorrhoids |
| Technique | Above dentate line |
| Sessions | May require multiple |
| Efficacy | 70-80% success |
| Complications | Pain, bleeding, rarely sepsis |

#### Infrared Coagulation
| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Indication | Grade I-II hemorrhoids |
| Mechanism | Coagulation necrosis |
| Sessions | Multiple often needed |
| Comparison | Less effective than RBL for larger hemorrhoids |

#### Sclerotherapy
| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Indication | Grade I-II hemorrhoids |
| Agents | Phenol in oil, others |
| Efficacy | Less than rubber band ligation |
| Role | May be useful when RBL contraindicated |

### Surgical Management

#### Indications
- Failed office procedures
- Grade III-IV internal hemorrhoids
- Large external component
- Combined internal/external disease
- Patient preference

#### Excisional Hemorrhoidectomy
| Technique | Notes |
|-----------|-------|
| Milligan-Morgan | Open technique |
| Ferguson | Closed technique |
| Energy devices | LigaSure, Harmonic |
| Efficacy | Most effective long-term |
| Pain | Significant postoperative pain |

#### Stapled Hemorrhoidopexy
| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Indication | Circumferential internal hemorrhoids |
| Mechanism | Resects mucosa, reduces blood flow |
| Pain | Less than excisional |
| Recurrence | Higher than excisional |
| Complications | Rare but serious (staple line complications) |

#### Doppler-Guided Hemorrhoid Artery Ligation
| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Mechanism | Ligate feeding arteries |
| With mucopexy | Address prolapse |
| Pain | Less than excisional |
| Recurrence | Variable |

### Special Situations

#### Thrombosed External Hemorrhoid
| Timing | Management |
|--------|------------|
| <72 hours | Excision if severe pain |
| >72 hours | Conservative management often successful |
| Recurrent | Consider elective hemorrhoidectomy |

#### Hemorrhoids in Pregnancy
| Recommendation | Details |
|----------------|---------|
| Conservative first | Fiber, sitz baths, topical agents |
| RBL | Generally avoided in pregnancy |
| Surgery | Rarely needed; postpartum if possible |

#### Hemorrhoids with Inflammatory Bowel Disease
- Caution with procedures
- Medical optimization first
- Surgical consultation recommended

#### Immunocompromised Patients
- Higher complication rates
- Conservative approach preferred
- Close monitoring required

#### Anticoagulation
| Scenario | Recommendation |
|----------|----------------|
| RBL | May hold anticoagulation |
| Hemorrhoidectomy | Per standard preoperative protocols |
| Risk assessment | Balance bleeding vs thrombotic risk |

### Postoperative Care

#### Pain Management
| Agent | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| Multimodal approach | Recommended |
| NSAIDs | Effective, use if not contraindicated |
| Opioids | Minimize; constipation risk |
| Sitz baths | Continue postoperatively |
| Stool softeners | Prevent hard stools |

#### Complications
| Complication | Management |
|--------------|------------|
| Urinary retention | Catheterization; usually temporary |
| Bleeding | Usually self-limited; rarely requires intervention |
| Fecal impaction | Prevent with laxatives |
| Anal stenosis | Rare; may require dilation |
