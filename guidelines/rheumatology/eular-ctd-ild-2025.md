## Scope
First comprehensive EULAR recommendations for the management of interstitial lung disease (ILD) associated with connective tissue diseases (CTDs), including systemic sclerosis (SSc), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), inflammatory myopathies (IIM), and mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD).

## Key Recommendations

### Screening and Diagnosis
- **HRCT**: High-resolution CT of the chest is the gold standard for diagnosis and characterizing the pattern of ILD.
- **Pulmonary Function Tests (PFTs)**: Baseline FVC and DLCO should be obtained in all patients with suspected CTD-ILD and used for monitoring.
- **Risk Factors**: Screen patients with CTD for ILD if they have respiratory symptoms or risk factors (e.g., anti-MDA5, anti-Scl-70 antibodies).

### Prognostication
- The pattern on HRCT (e.g., usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) vs. non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP)) and the extent of disease are key prognostic factors.
- Serial decline in FVC (>5-10% predicted) is a marker of disease progression.

### Pharmacological Management
- **Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF)**: A first-line immunosuppressant for most CTD-ILD, particularly SSc-ILD (Scleroderma Lung Study II).
- **Nintedanib**: An antifibrotic agent that can be used in addition to immunosuppression or as monotherapy for progressive fibrosing ILD (SENSCIS/INBUILD trials).
- **Rituximab**: May be considered for CTD-ILD, particularly RA-ILD and myositis-associated ILD.
- **Tocilizumab**: May be considered for SSc-ILD (FocuSSced trial).

### Rapidly Progressive ILD
- For rapidly progressive ILD (e.g., in antisynthetase syndrome or anti-MDA5 dermatomyositis), treatment escalation with high-dose corticosteroids, IV cyclophosphamide, and/or rituximab is recommended.

### Multidisciplinary Discussion (MDD)
- A multidisciplinary approach involving rheumatologists, pulmonologists, and radiologists is essential for diagnosis and management decisions.
