## Scope
Evidence-based recommendations for treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), covering hydroxychloroquine, glucocorticoids, immunosuppressants, and biologics.

## Overarching Principles

1. SLE requires multidisciplinary management
2. Treatment should aim for remission or low disease activity
3. Patient involvement in treatment decisions is essential
4. Prevention of organ damage and drug toxicity is critical
5. Cardiovascular risk factor management is important

## Key Recommendations

### Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ)

#### Universal Recommendation (Strong)
- **All SLE patients** should receive HCQ unless contraindicated
- Maximum dose: **5 mg/kg/day** (real weight)
- Reduces flares, organ damage, thrombotic events, and mortality

#### Monitoring
- Baseline ophthalmologic exam
- Annual screening after 5 years (or earlier if high-risk)

### Glucocorticoids

#### Minimization Strategy (Strong)
- Use the **lowest effective dose**
- Target: Prednisone ≤5 mg/day for maintenance (or withdraw completely)
- Higher doses for active disease, then taper rapidly

#### Pulse Therapy
- Methylprednisolone pulses (250-1000 mg IV) for severe flares
- Allows faster reduction of oral steroids

### Immunosuppressive Drugs

#### Methotrexate
- For skin, joint, and mild organ involvement
- Steroid-sparing agent

#### Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF)
- First-line for lupus nephritis (induction and maintenance)
- Also for other severe organ manifestations

#### Azathioprine (AZA)
- Maintenance therapy after induction
- Alternative when MMF contraindicated
- Safe in pregnancy (check TPMT)

#### Cyclophosphamide
- Severe organ-threatening disease (nephritis, CNS lupus)
- Use lower cumulative doses (Euro-Lupus protocol preferred)
- Avoid in reproductive-age women when possible

### Calcineurin Inhibitors

#### Voclosporin (New Addition)
- **Add to MMF** for lupus nephritis
- Approved based on AURORA trials
- Superior renal response when combined with MMF

#### Tacrolimus/Cyclosporine
- Alternative for lupus nephritis
- Multi-target therapy (with MMF) effective

### Biologics

#### Belimumab (Strong)
- Add for patients with inadequate response to standard therapy
- Reduces flares and steroid requirements
- IV or SC formulations

#### Anifrolumab (New Addition)
- Anti-interferon receptor antibody
- For moderate-severe SLE despite standard treatment
- Particularly effective for skin and joint disease

#### Rituximab
- For refractory disease
- Reserved for severe manifestations unresponsive to other therapies
- Off-label but widely used

### Lupus Nephritis

#### Induction Therapy
- **First-line**: MMF (2-3 g/day) + glucocorticoids
- Add voclosporin for improved renal response
- Add belimumab for additional benefit
- Alternative: Low-dose cyclophosphamide (Euro-Lupus)

#### Maintenance Therapy
- MMF or azathioprine
- Continue for at least 3-5 years after complete remission

### Special Populations

#### Pregnancy
- Continue HCQ (safe and beneficial)
- Use azathioprine if immunosuppression needed
- Avoid MMF, MTX, cyclophosphamide (teratogenic)

#### Antiphospholipid Syndrome
- Anticoagulation for thrombotic APS
- Low-dose aspirin for obstetric APS or high-risk patients

## Treatment Goals
- **Remission**: No disease activity on maintenance therapy (HCQ ± prednisone ≤5 mg)
- **Low disease activity (LLDAS)**: Minimal activity allowing treatment reduction
