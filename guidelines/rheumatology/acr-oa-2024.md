## Scope
2024 update to the ACR/Arthritis Foundation guideline for the management of osteoarthritis (OA) of the hand, hip, and knee.

## Key Recommendations

### Strongly Recommended (All OA Patients)
- **Exercise**: Land-based or aquatic exercise programs improve pain and function.
- **Weight Loss**: For overweight/obese patients with hip or knee OA, weight loss significantly reduces symptoms.
- **Self-Management Programs**: Patient education and self-efficacy programs.

### Pharmacologic Therapy

#### Topical Treatments (Knee, Hand OA)
- **Topical NSAIDs (e.g., diclofenac gel)**: Strongly recommended, especially for elderly or those at high GI/CV risk.

#### Oral Analgesics
- **Oral NSAIDs**: Effective for pain relief. Use lowest effective dose for shortest duration. Consider GI and CV risk.
- **Acetaminophen**: Conditionally recommended; limited efficacy.
- **Duloxetine**: Conditionally recommended as adjunctive therapy for knee OA with central sensitization features.

#### Intra-Articular Injections (Knee, Hip)
- **Corticosteroid Injections**: Conditionally recommended for short-term symptom relief.
- **Hyaluronic Acid Injections**: Conditionally recommended; variable evidence.
- **PRP, Stem Cell Injections**: No recommendation (insufficient evidence).

### Strongly Against
- **Opioids**: Strongly against routine use due to addiction risk and limited efficacy in OA.
- **Glucosamine/Chondroitin**: Generally not recommended based on lack of efficacy in large trials.

### Surgical Referral
- Refer for joint replacement (TKA, THA) when conservative management fails and patient has significant functional limitation and pain.

### Physical Modalities
- Assistive devices (canes, braces), thermal modalities, and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) may provide adjunctive benefit.
