## Scope

This guideline provides updated recommendations for the treatment of axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA), including ankylosing spondylitis (radiographic axSpA) and non-radiographic axSpA.

## Key Recommendations

### First-Line Therapy
**NSAIDs:**
- Continuous or on-demand NSAID therapy
- Trial of ≥2 NSAIDs before escalation
- Continuous preferred for sustained inflammation

### Biologic DMARDs
**TNF Inhibitors (First-Line Biologic):**
- Adalimumab, etanercept, certolizumab, golimumab, infliximab
- Consider for NSAID inadequate response
- No preference among TNF inhibitors

**IL-17 Inhibitors:**
- Secukinumab, ixekizumab
- Alternative first-line biologic or after TNF inadequate response
- Preferred if concomitant psoriasis

### JAK Inhibitors
- Tofacitinib, upadacitinib
- Option after biologic inadequate response
- Consider cardiovascular/thrombosis risk

### Treat-to-Target
- Aim for remission or low disease activity
- ASDAS as preferred measure
- Regular assessment of disease activity

### Physical Therapy
- Regular exercise program (essential adjunct)
- Physical therapy referral
- Maintain spinal mobility

### Not Recommended
- Methotrexate, sulfasalazine for axial disease
- Systemic glucocorticoids
- Local glucocorticoid injections for SI joints: Conditional use

### Peripheral Manifestations
- Sulfasalazine or methotrexate may help peripheral arthritis
- TNFi or IL-17i if biologic needed

### Extra-Articular Manifestations
- Uveitis: TNF monoclonal antibodies preferred over etanercept
- IBD: TNF monoclonal antibodies (not etanercept or IL-17i)
