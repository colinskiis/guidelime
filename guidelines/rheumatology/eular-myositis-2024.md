## Scope
2024 EULAR recommendations for the diagnosis and management of idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM), including dermatomyositis (DM), polymyositis (PM), antisynthetase syndrome (ASS), and necrotizing autoimmune myopathy (NAM).

## Key Recommendations

### Diagnosis
- **Clinical Features**: Proximal muscle weakness, skin manifestations (heliotrope rash, Gottron's papules in DM), ILD, dysphagia.
- **Muscle Enzymes**: Elevated CK, aldolase.
- **Myositis-Specific Antibodies (MSAs)**: Anti-Jo-1 (ASS), anti-Mi-2, anti-MDA5, anti-NXP2, anti-TIF1-γ, anti-SRP, anti-HMGCR (NAM).
- **EMG, MRI**: Myopathic pattern, muscle edema.
- **Muscle Biopsy**: Gold standard for diagnosis.

### Initial Treatment
- **High-Dose Glucocorticoids**: Prednisone 1 mg/kg/day (max 60-80 mg) as first-line.
- Taper over months based on clinical response.
- Early introduction of steroid-sparing agents is recommended.

### Steroid-Sparing Agents
- **Methotrexate or Azathioprine**: First-choice conventional immunosuppressants.
- **Mycophenolate Mofetil**: Alternative, particularly for ILD.
- **Rituximab**: For refractory disease, particularly anti-Jo-1 positive or anti-SRP/HMGCR NAM.
- **IVIG**: Effective for DM skin manifestations and dysphagia; also used for refractory myositis.

### Specific Phenotypes

#### Antisynthetase Syndrome (ASS)
- High risk of ILD; prioritize MMF or rituximab if ILD present.

#### Anti-MDA5 DM
- High risk of rapidly progressive ILD. Aggressive combination immunosuppression (rituximab + calcineurin inhibitor + corticosteroids).

#### Necrotizing Autoimmune Myopathy (NAM)
- Often requires aggressive therapy: IVIG + immunosuppression; rituximab for anti-SRP or anti-HMGCR.

#### Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM)
- Generally resistant to immunosuppression. Supportive care, PT, dysphagia management.

### Malignancy Screening
- IIM (especially DM) is associated with increased cancer risk. Screen at diagnosis and periodically.
