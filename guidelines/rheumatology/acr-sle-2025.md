## Scope
Comprehensive update (first since 1999) providing evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis, monitoring, and pharmacological management of adults with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

## Key Recommendations

### Foundation of Therapy
- **Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ)**: Recommended for **all** patients with SLE unless contraindicated. 
  - Aim for a dose of ≤5 mg/kg real body weight to minimize retinal toxicity.
  - Long-term use is associated with reduced flares, organ damage prevention, and improved survival.

### Glucocorticoid Stewardship
- **Minimization Strategy**: Emphasizes using the lowest effective dose of oral glucocorticoids for the shortest duration possible.
- **Tapering**: Aim to taper prednisone to ≤5 mg/day (or completely discontinue) whenever clinical disease activity allows.
- **Pulse Therapy**: IV methylprednisolone pulses (e.g., 250-1000 mg/day for 1-3 days) are preferred for severe organ-threatening disease to allow for lower oral maintenance doses.

### Biologic and Immunosuppressive Therapies
- **Early Introduction**: Consider adding biologics (e.g., belimumab, anifrolumab) or conventional immunosuppressants (e.g., methotrexate, azathioprine, mycophenolate) early in the disease course to achieve remission and spare glucocorticoids.
- **Anifrolumab**: Strong recommendation for use in patients with moderate-to-severe SLE (non-renal/non-neuropsychiatric) who remain symptomatic despite standard therapy.
- **Belimumab**: Recommended for both non-renal SLE and lupus nephritis (LN).

### Lupus Nephritis (LN)
- **Initial Therapy**: Combination therapy (e.g., Mycophenolate or low-dose cyclophosphamide + glucocorticoids) remains the standard.
- **Add-on Biologics**: Belimumab should be considered as add-on therapy for all patients with active LN to improve renal response rates.
- **Voclosporin**: Recommended as part of a triple-therapy regimen (with MMF and corticosteroids) for active Class III, IV, or V LN.

### Comorbidity Management
- **Cardiovascular Risk**: Annual screening and aggressive management of hypertension and dyslipidemia.
- **Bone Health**: Screen for osteoporosis and provide prophylaxis for those on long-term glucocorticoids.
- **Vaccination**: Ensure up-to-date immunizations (e.g., flu, pneumococcal, shingles) following ACR vaccination guidelines.
- **Antiphospholipid Antibodies (aPL)**: Screen all SLE patients; consider low-dose aspirin for primary prevention in those with high-risk aPL profiles.
