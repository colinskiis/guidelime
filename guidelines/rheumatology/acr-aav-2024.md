## Scope
2024 ACR guideline update for the management of ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV): granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA).

## Key Recommendations

### Remission Induction (Severe/Active Disease)

#### GPA and MPA
- **Rituximab**: Conditionally recommended over cyclophosphamide for most patients.
- **Cyclophosphamide**: Still an effective option, especially for severe disease with alveolar hemorrhage or rapidly progressive GN.
- **Glucocorticoids**: High-dose initially (prednisone 1 mg/kg or IV pulse methylprednisolone), then taper.
- **Avacopan (C5aR Inhibitor)**: May be used as adjunct to rituximab or cyclophosphamide; can reduce glucocorticoid exposure.

#### EGPA
- Glucocorticoids ± mepolizumab or cyclophosphamide depending on severity.

### Remission Maintenance
- **Rituximab**: Preferred maintenance agent for GPA/MPA.
- Continue for at least 2 years; consider longer in patients with high relapse risk.
- **Azathioprine or Methotrexate**: Alternatives if rituximab is not feasible.

### Glucocorticoid Reduction
- Aim for rapid taper over 4-6 months to minimize long-term steroid harm.
- Avacopan can facilitate steroid tapering.

### Refractory Disease
- Consider alternative agents (e.g., switch from rituximab to cyclophosphamide or vice versa).
- Plasma exchange: May be considered for severe renal involvement or alveolar hemorrhage; recent trials show less benefit than previously thought.

### Monitoring
- Serial ANCA levels, renal function, urinalysis, inflammatory markers.
- Watch for infection risk (especially PJP with high-dose steroids/cyclophosphamide – prophylaxis with TMP-SMX).
