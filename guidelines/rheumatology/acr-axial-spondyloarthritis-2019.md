# ACR/SAA/SPARTAN Guidelines for Treatment of Ankylosing Spondylitis and Nonradiographic Axial Spondyloarthritis

## Scope
Evidence-based recommendations for the pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic treatment of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and nonradiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA) in adults.

## Key Recommendations

### General Principles
- Treatment decisions should be shared between patient and clinician
- Regular disease activity assessment recommended
- Treatment goals: reduce symptoms, maintain function, prevent structural damage

### First-Line Treatment

#### NSAIDs (Strong Recommendation)
- First-line pharmacotherapy for active axSpA
- Trial of at least 2 different NSAIDs before concluding NSAID failure
- Continuous vs. on-demand: Continuous preferred for persistently active disease

#### NSAID Selection
| Consideration | Recommendation |
|---------------|----------------|
| GI risk | Add PPI; consider COX-2 selective |
| CV risk | Naproxen may have lower CV risk |
| Renal impairment | Use with caution; avoid if severe |

### Biologic DMARDs

#### TNF Inhibitors (Strong Recommendation)
First-line biologic after NSAID failure

| Agent | Dosing |
|-------|--------|
| Adalimumab | 40 mg SC every 2 weeks |
| Certolizumab | 400 mg SC at 0, 2, 4 weeks, then 200 mg every 2 weeks |
| Etanercept | 50 mg SC weekly |
| Golimumab | 50 mg SC monthly |
| Infliximab | 5 mg/kg IV at 0, 2, 6 weeks, then every 6-8 weeks |

#### IL-17 Inhibitors
| Agent | Dosing | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Secukinumab | 150 mg SC at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 weeks, then monthly | May increase to 300 mg |
| Ixekizumab | 80 mg SC at 0, 2, 4 weeks, then every 4 weeks | |

#### Biologic Selection
- No head-to-head trials comparing biologics
- TNF inhibitors recommended over IL-17 inhibitors as first biologic (conditional)
- IL-17 inhibitors preferred if concomitant psoriasis
- Avoid IL-17 inhibitors if active IBD

### JAK Inhibitors

#### Tofacitinib
- 5 mg BID
- Alternative to biologics
- Contraindicated with active infection, high VTE risk

#### Upadacitinib
- 15 mg daily
- FDA approved for AS

### Switching Biologics

#### After First TNFi Failure
| Scenario | Recommendation |
|----------|----------------|
| Primary non-response | Switch class (IL-17i or JAKi) |
| Secondary non-response | Second TNFi or switch class |
| Intolerance | Second TNFi reasonable |

### Conventional DMARDs

#### Sulfasalazine
- May be considered for peripheral arthritis
- Limited efficacy for axial disease
- Dose: 2-3 g daily

#### Methotrexate
- NOT recommended for axial disease
- May help peripheral arthritis

### Local Glucocorticoids
- Intra-articular injections for peripheral joints
- SI joint injections may be considered

### Systemic Glucocorticoids
- NOT recommended for long-term use
- Short courses may be used for flares (conditional)

### Non-Pharmacologic Treatment

#### Physical Therapy (Strong)
- Regular exercise program
- Stretching and range of motion
- Postural training
- Swimming and aquatic therapy

#### Patient Education
- Disease nature and prognosis
- Importance of exercise
- Smoking cessation
- Medication adherence

### Monitoring

#### Disease Activity Assessment
- BASDAI or ASDAS
- CRP and ESR
- Patient-reported outcomes

#### Safety Monitoring
- TB screening before biologics
- Hepatitis B/C testing
- Regular monitoring per drug requirements

### Special Populations

#### Pregnancy
- NSAIDs: Avoid in third trimester
- TNFi: May continue early pregnancy (discuss risk/benefit)
- IL-17i: Limited data
- Certolizumab: Minimal placental transfer

#### IBD Comorbidity
- TNF monoclonal antibodies preferred (adalimumab, infliximab)
- Avoid IL-17 inhibitors (may worsen IBD)
- Avoid etanercept (less effective for IBD)

#### Uveitis Comorbidity
- TNF monoclonal antibodies preferred
- Avoid etanercept

### Surgical Considerations
- Hip arthroplasty for severe hip involvement
- Spinal surgery for fracture or severe kyphosis
