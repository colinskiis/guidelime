## Scope
Evidence-based recommendations for the management of axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA), including both ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and nonradiographic axial SpA (nr-axSpA).

## Overarching Principles

1. axSpA is a serious disease with diverse manifestations requiring multidisciplinary management
2. Treatment should aim at best care, based on shared decision between patient and rheumatologist
3. Rheumatologists are specialists who should primarily care for axSpA patients
4. High costs of some treatments should be considered
5. Treatment should be optimized according to disease activity, structural damage, comorbidities, and patient factors

## Key Recommendations

### Disease Monitoring

#### Assessment Tools
| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| ASDAS | Disease activity (preferred) |
| BASDAI | Disease activity (alternative) |
| CRP | Inflammation marker |
| MRI | Inflammation, disease progression |
| X-ray | Structural damage |

#### Disease Activity States (ASDAS)
| ASDAS Score | State |
|-------------|-------|
| <1.3 | Inactive disease |
| 1.3-2.0 | Low disease activity |
| 2.1-3.5 | High disease activity |
| >3.5 | Very high disease activity |

### Non-Pharmacological Management

#### Patient Education (Strong)
- Disease information
- Exercise importance
- Smoking cessation
- Posture and ergonomics

#### Physical Therapy (Strong)
- Regular exercise
- Flexibility and strengthening
- Supervised > unsupervised
- Aquatic therapy beneficial

### Pharmacological Treatment

#### NSAIDs (First-Line)
- Recommended for symptomatic axSpA
- Use continuously if persistently active disease
- Consider CV and GI risks
- Trial ≥2 NSAIDs before escalation

#### Analgesics
- Paracetamol/acetaminophen
- Opioids rarely appropriate

#### Conventional DMARDs
| Agent | Role |
|-------|------|
| Sulfasalazine | Peripheral arthritis only |
| Methotrexate | Not for axial disease |
| Leflunomide | Peripheral arthritis only |

#### Glucocorticoids
- Local injections for peripheral arthritis/enthesitis
- Systemic use NOT recommended long-term

### Biologic DMARDs (bDMARDs)

#### Indications
- Persistently high disease activity (ASDAS ≥2.1)
- Despite ≥2 NSAIDs over 4 weeks
- No preference between TNFi and IL-17i for first bDMARD

#### TNF Inhibitors
| Agent | Standard Dose |
|-------|---------------|
| Adalimumab | 40 mg every 2 weeks |
| Certolizumab | 200 mg every 2 weeks (after loading) |
| Etanercept | 50 mg weekly |
| Golimumab | 50 mg monthly |
| Infliximab | 5 mg/kg every 6-8 weeks |

#### IL-17 Inhibitors
| Agent | Standard Dose |
|-------|---------------|
| Secukinumab | 150 mg monthly (may use 300 mg) |
| Ixekizumab | 80 mg every 4 weeks |

#### Choosing Between TNFi and IL-17i
| Situation | Preference |
|-----------|------------|
| Coexistent IBD | TNF monoclonal antibody |
| Recurrent uveitis | TNF monoclonal antibody |
| Coexistent psoriasis | Either; IL-17i effective |
| Primary TNFi failure | Switch to IL-17i |

### JAK Inhibitors (JAKi)

#### Indications
- After failure or intolerance to bDMARDs
- May be used after NSAID failure if bDMARD not appropriate

#### Available Agents
| Agent | Dose |
|-------|------|
| Tofacitinib | 5 mg twice daily |
| Upadacitinib | 15 mg daily |

### Treatment Strategies

#### Treat-to-Target
- Target: Remission (ASDAS <1.3) or low disease activity
- Regular monitoring and adjustment
- Consider tapering if sustained remission

#### Switching bDMARDs
| Scenario | Recommendation |
|----------|----------------|
| Inadequate response to first TNFi | Second TNFi or IL-17i or JAKi |
| Inadequate response to first IL-17i | TNFi or second IL-17i or JAKi |
| Secondary failure | Same class may work |
| Intolerance | Same class reasonable |

#### Tapering
- Consider in sustained remission
- Gradual dose reduction preferred over discontinuation
- Monitor for relapse
- Dose reduction preferred over stopping

### Extra-Articular Manifestations

#### Anterior Uveitis
- Ophthalmology referral
- TNF monoclonal antibodies reduce recurrence

#### IBD
- GI referral if suspected
- TNF monoclonal antibodies (infliximab, adalimumab)
- Avoid IL-17 inhibitors

#### Psoriasis
- Dermatology collaboration
- Multiple effective options

### Comorbidities
- CV risk assessment and management
- Osteoporosis screening
- Depression screening
- Fibromyalgia assessment

### Surgical Treatment
- Hip arthroplasty if needed
- Spinal surgery for severe kyphosis or fracture
- Multidisciplinary planning
