# ACR Guideline for the Management of Gout

## Scope
Evidence-based recommendations for management of gout, including urate-lowering therapy (ULT) and acute flare management. Updates the 2012 ACR gout guidelines.

## Key Recommendations

### Indications for Urate-Lowering Therapy (Strong)
ULT strongly recommended for:
- Tophaceous gout
- Radiographic damage due to gout
- Frequent gout flares (≥2/year)

ULT conditionally recommended for:
- First gout flare with CKD stage ≥3
- First flare with serum urate >9 mg/dL
- First flare with urolithiasis

### Urate-Lowering Therapy

#### First-Line Agent (Strong)
**Allopurinol** is preferred first-line ULT:
- Effective when dosed appropriately
- Safe and well-tolerated
- Lower cost
- Safe in CKD (with dose adjustment)

#### Starting Dose (Strong)
- **Allopurinol**: Start ≤100 mg/day (lower in CKD stage ≥3)
- **Febuxostat**: Start <40 mg/day

#### Treat-to-Target (Strong)
- Titrate ULT to achieve serum urate **<6 mg/dL**
- Serial serum urate measurements guide dosing
- Allopurinol may require doses >300 mg/day (up to 800 mg/day)

#### HLA-B*5801 Testing
- **Strongly recommend** testing in patients of Southeast Asian or African American descent before starting allopurinol
- Higher risk of severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR)

### Flare Prophylaxis (Strong)
When initiating ULT:
- Provide concomitant anti-inflammatory prophylaxis
- Duration: At least **3-6 months**
- Options: Low-dose colchicine, NSAIDs, or low-dose prednisone

### Acute Flare Management

#### First-Line Options (Strong)
- **Colchicine**: Low-dose regimen (1.2 mg then 0.6 mg 1 hour later)
- **NSAIDs**: Full anti-inflammatory dose
- **Glucocorticoids**: Oral, intra-articular, or intramuscular

#### Selection Considerations
| Option | Consider When |
|--------|---------------|
| Colchicine | Within 36 hours of flare onset |
| NSAIDs | No contraindications (renal, GI, CV) |
| Glucocorticoids | CKD, NSAID contraindication, polyarticular |
| IL-1 inhibitors | Refractory to other options |

### Lifestyle Recommendations

#### Conditionally Recommend
- Limit alcohol (especially beer)
- Limit high-purine foods (organ meats, certain seafood)
- Limit high-fructose corn syrup
- Weight loss if overweight/obese

#### Do NOT Recommend
- Stopping ULT due to acute flare
- Vitamin C supplementation for urate lowering

### Medication Considerations

#### Febuxostat
- Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease
- Based on CARES trial showing increased CV mortality (subsequent studies conflicting)
- Consider if allopurinol contraindicated or ineffective

#### Probenecid
- Second-line uricosuric agent
- Avoid in CKD or urolithiasis

#### Pegloticase
- Reserved for severe, refractory gout
- Patients failing other ULT options

### Comorbid Medications
- Continue low-dose aspirin (cardioprotective) despite modest urate elevation
- Switch hydrochlorothiazide to losartan if possible (losartan has mild uricosuric effect)

## Key Points
- Treat-to-target approach with serum urate goal <6 mg/dL
- Allopurinol preferred first-line; start low, go slow
- Flare prophylaxis essential when starting ULT
- Don't stop ULT during acute flare
