## Scope
2024 EULAR recommendations for the management of fibromyalgia syndrome.

## Key Recommendations

### Diagnosis
- Clinical diagnosis based on widespread pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance, cognitive dysfunction.
- ACR 2016 criteria or clinical judgment.
- Exclude other conditions (inflammatory arthritis, hypothyroidism, etc.) but fibromyalgia can coexist with other diseases.

### Patient Education
- Validate symptoms; explain central sensitization.
- Set realistic expectations for treatment.

### First-Line Treatment (Non-Pharmacologic)

#### Exercise (Strongly Recommended)
- **Aerobic Exercise**: Walking, swimming, cycling. Most evidence.
- **Strength Training, Aquatic Therapy, Tai Chi, Yoga**: Beneficial.
- Start low, progress gradually.

#### Psychological Therapies
- **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)**: Effective for pain, function, and mood.
- Mindfulness-based stress reduction.

### Second-Line / Pharmacologic Therapy
- Pharmacotherapy is adjunct, not first-line.

#### Recommended Medications
- **Amitriptyline (Low-Dose TCA)**: 10-50 mg at bedtime. Helps pain, sleep.
- **Duloxetine (SNRI)**: 60-120 mg/day. FDA-approved.
- **Milnacipran (SNRI)**: FDA-approved.
- **Pregabalin**: 150-450 mg/day. FDA-approved; helps pain and sleep.
- **Gabapentin**: Off-label alternative.
- **Cyclobenzaprine**: May improve sleep.

### Avoid / Limited Benefit
- Opioids: NOT recommended (lack efficacy, risk of harm).
- NSAIDs, Corticosteroids: Ineffective for fibromyalgia.
- Gabapentinoids and SNRIs have modest effect sizes; benefit varies.

### Multimodal Approach
- Combination of exercise + psychological therapy + pharmacotherapy tailored to individual.
- Address sleep, mood, and comorbidities.
