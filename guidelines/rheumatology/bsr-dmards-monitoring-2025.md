## Scope
Comprehensive 2025 update regarding the safe prescription and evidence-based laboratory monitoring of conventional synthetic DMARDs (csDMARDs) in children, adolescents, and adults.

## Key Recommendations

### Pre-treatment Assessment
- **Required Tests**: Baseline FBC, LFTs (ALT/AST, Albumin), and Creatinine/eGFR are mandatory for all csDMARDs.
- **Screening**: Viral screening (HBV, HCV, HIV) and TB screening (IGRA/Chest X-ray) should be considered based on local prevalence and specific drug risk (highest for leflunomide/methotrexate).

### Monitoring Frequency
- **Induction Phase**: Recommends monitoring (FBC, LFTs, Creatinine) every 2 weeks until the dose is stable for 6 weeks.
- **Maintenance Phase**: 
  - For stable doses: Monitoring typically every 3 months.
  - **Methotrexate**: May extend monitoring to every 6 months in low-risk, stable patients after 1 year of therapy.
  - **Hydroxychloroquine**: Routine laboratory monitoring (FBC/LFTs) is no longer recommended due to excellent safety profile, but annual ophthalmic screening (e.g., OCT/FAF) is mandatory after 5 years of use.

### Specific Drug Management
- **Methotrexate**: Folic acid supplementation (at least 5mg weekly) is mandatory to reduce GI toxicity and hepatotoxicity.
- **Sulfasalazine**: Requires FBC monitoring every 3 months for the first year, then can be stopped or reduced if stable, provided no other DMARDs used.
- **Leflunomide**: Blood pressure monitoring is mandatory at every visit due to risk of hypertension.

### Management of Abnormalities
- **ALT/AST**: If >2x ULN, withhold drug and re-test within 1-2 weeks. If persistent or >3x ULN, consider dose reduction or discontinuation.
- **Neutropenia**: If Neutrophils <1.5 x 10^9/L, withhold drug and investigate; if <0.5, urgent specialist hematology advice is required.

### Vaccination
- **Live Vaccines**: Generally contraindicated for patients on methotrexate or leflunomide.
- **Non-live Vaccines**: (e.g., Influenza, COVID-19, Pneumococcus) Recommended and should ideally be given prior to starting therapy or during stable maintenance.

### Peri-operative Management
- **Methotrexate**: Generally safe to continue for minor surgeries. For major elective surgery, clinical judgement is required; some evidence supports continuation to avoid peri-operative flares.
