## Scope
2024 ACR guideline for the diagnosis and management of giant cell arteritis (GCA).

## Key Recommendations

### Diagnosis
- **Clinical Suspicion**: New-onset headache, scalp tenderness, jaw claudication, visual disturbances (amaurosis fugax, diplopia), constitutional symptoms in adults >50 years.
- **Temporal Artery Biopsy (TAB)**: Remains the gold standard. Should not delay treatment if clinical suspicion is high.
- **Imaging**: Halo sign on temporal artery ultrasound, or FDG-PET/MRA showing large vessel vasculitis can support diagnosis.

### Initial Treatment
- **High-Dose Glucocorticoids**: Start immediately upon clinical suspicion.
  - **With Visual Symptoms**: Consider IV methylprednisolone 1g daily for 3 days, then oral prednisone 1 mg/kg/day.
  - **Without Visual Symptoms**: Oral prednisone 40-60 mg/day.
- Do NOT delay steroids for biopsy.

### Glucocorticoid-Sparing Therapy
- **Tocilizumab (IL-6 inhibitor)**: Strong recommendation to add tocilizumab (weekly SC or monthly IV) for patients with new or relapsing GCA.
- Benefits: Faster, more sustained remission; reduces cumulative steroid dose and steroid-related complications.

### Glucocorticoid Taper
- Slow, individualized taper over 12-24 months (or longer) guided by symptoms and inflammatory markers.
- Relapses are common during taper.

### Monitoring
- ESR, CRP at baseline and during taper.
- Monitor for steroid-related adverse effects (osteoporosis, diabetes, hypertension, cataracts, infections).
- Bone protection (calcium, vitamin D, bisphosphonate).

### Referral
- Ophthalmology referral for any visual symptoms.
