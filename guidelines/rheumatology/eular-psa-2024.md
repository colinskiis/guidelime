## Scope
2024 EULAR recommendations for the pharmacological and non-pharmacological management of psoriatic arthritis (PsA).

## Key Recommendations

### Overarching Principles
- Treat-to-target approach (target: remission or low disease activity).
- Shared decision-making with the patient.
- Consider all disease domains: peripheral arthritis, axial disease, enthesitis, dactylitis, skin/nail psoriasis.

### First-Line Therapy (Peripheral Arthritis)
- **csDMARD (Methotrexate, Sulfasalazine, Leflunomide)**: Initial treatment for peripheral arthritis, especially with relevant skin psoriasis. Methotrexate is preferred.
- NSAIDs for symptom control.

### Inadequate Response to csDMARD or Active Disease with Poor Prognosis
- **bDMARD or JAKi**: Move to biologic or targeted synthetic DMARD.
- **TNF Inhibitors (Adalimumab, Etanercept, Infliximab, Golimumab, Certolizumab)**: Established efficacy across all PsA domains.
- **IL-17 Inhibitors (Secukinumab, Ixekizumab, Bimekizumab)**: High efficacy for skin, peripheral arthritis, enthesitis, axial disease.
- **IL-12/23 Inhibitor (Ustekinumab)** or **IL-23 Inhibitors (Guselkumab, Risankizumab)**: Good for skin and peripheral arthritis; varying data on axial disease.
- **JAK Inhibitors (Tofacitinib, Upadacitinib)**: Oral option; effective across domains. Consider CV/thrombosis risk.

### Axial Disease
- NSAIDs first-line.
- TNF inhibitors or IL-17 inhibitors if inadequate response.
- csDMARDs are NOT effective for axial disease.

### Enthesitis and Dactylitis
- IL-17 inhibitors and TNF inhibitors are effective.

### Skin/Nail Psoriasis
- IL-17 inhibitors, IL-23 inhibitors have high skin clearance rates.

### Monitoring
- Regular assessment of disease activity (DAPSA, MDA), imaging, and comorbidities (CVD, metabolic syndrome).
