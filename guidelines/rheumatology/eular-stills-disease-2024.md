## Scope
First joint EULAR/PReS recommendations for the diagnosis and management of Still's disease, covering both adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD) and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA), recognizing them as a single disease spectrum.

## Key Recommendations

### Diagnosis
- **Clinical Features**: Still's disease is characterized by quotidian (daily spiking) fevers, evanescent salmon-colored rash, arthritis, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and markedly elevated serum ferritin.
- **Ferritin**: A serum ferritin level >5 times the upper limit of normal is highly suggestive, particularly with a low glycosylated ferritin fraction (<20%).
- **Exclusion of Mimics**: Infectious, malignant, and other autoinflammatory conditions must be excluded.

### Pharmacological Management
- **Corticosteroids**: Often used for initial symptom control, but the goal is to achieve steroid-free remission.
- **IL-1 Inhibitors (Anakinra, Canakinumab)**: Strongly recommended as first-line targeted therapy, especially for patients with systemic features predominating.
- **IL-6 Inhibitors (Tocilizumab)**: An effective alternative, particularly if there is significant arthritis.
- **DMARDs (Methotrexate)**: May be useful as corticosteroid-sparing agents, particularly for articular disease.

### Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS)
- **High-Risk Complication**: MAS is a potentially fatal complication. Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for falling or plateauing ferritin, cytopenias, liver dysfunction, and coagulopathy.
- **Treatment**: High-dose IV corticosteroids, with escalation to anakinra, cyclosporine, and/or etoposide in refractory cases.

### Monitoring
- Monitor disease activity (inflammatory markers, ferritin), drug toxicity, and for the development of amyloidosis in chronic disease.
