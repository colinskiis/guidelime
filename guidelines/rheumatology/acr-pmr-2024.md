## Scope
2024 ACR guideline on the diagnosis and management of polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR).

## Key Recommendations

### Diagnosis
- **Clinical Features**: Bilateral shoulder pain and stiffness, often with hip/neck involvement, in adults ≥50 years.
- **Inflammatory Markers**: Elevated ESR and/or CRP (usually markedly elevated).
- **Response to Glucocorticoids**: Dramatic improvement within days supports diagnosis.
- Rule out other conditions: RA, inflammatory myopathy, malignancy, infection.

### Imaging
- **Ultrasound**: May show subacromial bursitis, biceps tenosynovitis, glenohumeral synovitis, trochanteric bursitis; supports diagnosis.
- Consider imaging if diagnosis uncertain.

### Evaluate for Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA)
- Screen for GCA symptoms (headache, jaw claudication, visual symptoms, scalp tenderness).
- Temporal artery biopsy or temporal artery ultrasound if GCA suspected.

### Glucocorticoid Therapy (Mainstay)

#### Initial Dose
- **Prednisone 12.5-25 mg/day** (use lowest effective dose).
- Higher doses increase side effects without added efficacy for pure PMR.

#### Taper
- Gradual taper over 1-2 years:
  - Reduce by 2.5 mg every 2-4 weeks until 10 mg.
  - Then reduce by 1 mg every 4 weeks.
- Monitor for relapse; increase dose if symptoms recur.

### Steroid-Sparing Agents
- **Methotrexate**: Consider early for patients with high relapse risk, steroid-related adverse effects, or difficulty tapering.
- Dose: 7.5-15 mg/week.

### Monitoring
- Clinical symptoms, inflammatory markers (ESR, CRP).
- Monitor for GC side effects: Osteoporosis (calcium, vitamin D, bisphosphonate), hyperglycemia, hypertension.

### Duration
- Most patients can discontinue therapy within 1-2 years; some require longer or develop relapses.
