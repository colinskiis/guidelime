## Scope
2025 Joint Trauma System clinical practice guideline for the use of Resuscitative Endovascular Balloon Occlusion of the Aorta (REBOA) in patients with hemorrhagic shock due to non-compressible torso hemorrhage (NCTH).

## Key Recommendations

### Indications
- **Non-Compressible Torso Hemorrhage (NCTH)**: Patients with hemorrhagic shock (SBP <90 mmHg or non-responsive to resuscitation) due to intra-abdominal, pelvic, or junctional hemorrhage.
- **Bridge to Definitive Care**: REBOA serves as a temporary adjunct to resuscitation, bridging the patient to definitive surgical or IR-based hemorrhage control.

### Contraindications
- Known or suspected thoracic aortic injury.
- Severe TBI (relative contraindication due to hypertensive effects proximal to balloon).

### Balloon Placement Zones
- **Zone I (Descending Thoracic Aorta)**: For abdominal hemorrhage.
- **Zone III (Infrarenal Aorta)**: For pelvic or junctional hemorrhage.
- **Zone II (Paravisceral Aorta)**: Avoid placement in Zone II.

### Occlusion Strategy
- **Full Occlusion**: For profound shock or arrest.
- **Partial REBOA (pREBOA)**: Titrated inflation to allow some distal flow, to mitigate ischemia-reperfusion injury; may be used in more stable patients as a temporizing measure.

### Time Limits
- Minimize total aortic occlusion time. Prolonged occlusion (>60-90 minutes full occlusion) increases risk of severe ischemia-reperfusion injury, multi-organ failure, and mortality.

### Transition to Definitive Care
- Once REBOA is deployed, expedite definitive hemorrhage control (laparotomy, pelvic packing, angioembolization, etc.).
- Plan for balloon deflation sequentially with surgical hemorrhage control.

### Complications
- Arterial access site complications (thrombosis, pseudoaneurysm).
- Distal ischemia and reperfusion injury (lactic acidosis, limb ischemia, AKI).
