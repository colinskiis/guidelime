## Scope
Comprehensive 2025 joint WSES-AAST guideline for the management of blunt and penetrating thoracic trauma in adults.

## Key Recommendations

### Initial Assessment
- **Chest X-Ray**: Initial screening for hemothorax, pneumothorax, wide mediastinum.
- **CT Chest**: Indicated for stable patients with significant mechanism or abnormal CXR; provides detailed assessment of pulmonary contusion, occult pneumothorax, and vascular injury.
- **eFAST**: Extended FAST can identify pneumothorax and hemothorax at the bedside in unstable patients.

### Pneumothorax
- **Occult Pneumothorax**: Small, occult pneumothorax in a stable patient not requiring positive pressure ventilation may be observed.
- **Tube Thoracostomy**: For large, symptomatic, or tension pneumothorax. Use 28-32 Fr chest tube.
- **Tension Pneumothorax**: Immediate decompression (needle or finger thoracostomy) followed by tube thoracostomy.

### Hemothorax
- **Tube Thoracostomy**: Indicated for hemothorax with significant output or respiratory compromise.
- **Retained Hemothorax**: If >500 mL or persistent hemothorax after chest tube, consider VATS (video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery) for evacuation within 72-96 hours.
- **Massive Hemothorax (>1500 mL initially or >200 mL/hr for 2-4 hours)**: Consider thoracotomy for hemorrhage control.

### Rib Fractures
- **Analgesia**: Aggressive multimodal pain control (epidural, paravertebral block, IV analgesia) to prevent splinting and pulmonary complications.
- **Pulmonary Hygiene**: Incentive spirometry, early mobilization.
- **Surgical Rib Fixation (SSRF)**: May be considered for flail chest, severely displaced fractures, or refractory pain.

### Blunt Aortic Injury (BAI)
- **Diagnosis**: CT angiography is the gold standard.
- **Management**: Most Grade II-IV injuries require endovascular repair (TEVAR), unless stable Grade II with short-term follow-up.

### Penetrating Cardiac Injury
- **Emergency Department Thoracotomy (EDT)**: May be considered for patients with witnessed cardiac arrest or profound hypotension from penetrating trauma.
