## Scope
First comprehensive ESVS guidelines providing 105 recommendations for the management of vascular trauma, covering assessment, resuscitation, and definitive repair.

## Key Recommendations

### Initial Management
- **Hemorrhage Control**: Direct pressure and, if necessary, tourniquet application for extremity hemorrhage.
- **Damage Control Resuscitation**: For patients in hemorrhagic shock, permissive hypotension, balanced blood product transfusion (1:1:1), and minimizing crystalloid use.
- **CT Angiography**: The imaging modality of choice for stable patients with suspected vascular injury.

### Extremity Arterial Injury
- **Indications for Surgery**: Hard signs of vascular injury (pulsatile bleeding, expanding hematoma, absent distal pulses, palpable thrill/bruit).
- **Surgical Repair**: Primary repair, patch angioplasty, interposition graft (reversed saphenous vein preferred), or bypass.
- **Temporary Intravascular Shunting**: May be used in damage control settings to restore perfusion prior to definitive repair.
- **Endovascular Repair**: Stent grafts may be used for select arterial injuries, particularly in axillo-subclavian and iliac vessels.

### Compartment Syndrome
- **Fasciotomy**: Perform prophylactic or therapeutic fasciotomy for prolonged ischemia (>4-6 hours), combined arterial and venous injury, or clinical signs of compartment syndrome.

### Venous Injury
- **Repair vs. Ligation**: Repair major veins (e.g., femoral, popliteal) when feasible in stable patients. Ligation is acceptable for damage control or when repair is not possible.

### Aortic and Iliac Injury
- **Endovascular Repair (TEVAR/EVAR)**: Preferred for stable patients with blunt thoracic aortic injury and some iliac injuries.
- **Open Repair**: For unstable patients or when endovascular is not feasible.

### Follow-Up
- Surveillance imaging (duplex ultrasound or CTA) is recommended after vascular repair to assess for stenosis, occlusion, or pseudoaneurysm.
