## Scope
Evidence-based recommendations for the management of trauma in elderly and frail patients, developed using GRADE methodology and approved at the 10th WSES International Congress in 2023.

## Key Recommendations

### Background

#### Epidemiology
| Factor | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Mortality | Higher in elderly compared with younger patients |
| Population trend | Increasing elderly trauma patients |
| Mechanism | Falls predominant; MVC common |
| Outcomes | Worse at equivalent injury severity |

#### Physiologic Considerations
- Cardiovascular changes with aging
- Reduced physiologic reserve
- Altered response to stress
- Polypharmacy effects
- Comorbidity burden

### Frailty Assessment

#### Importance
| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Mortality predictor | Independent risk factor |
| Not just chronological age | Functional status matters |
| Validated tools | Multiple assessment instruments |
| Early identification | Guides treatment intensity |

#### Assessment Tools
| Tool | Notes |
|------|-------|
| Clinical Frailty Scale | Commonly used, practical |
| Frailty Index | Comprehensive, more detailed |
| FRAIL Scale | Simple screening tool |
| Phenotype model | Research-validated |

### Triage and Initial Assessment

#### Prehospital
| Recommendation | Details |
|----------------|---------|
| Low threshold for trauma center | Consider undertriage risk |
| Vital signs | May be normal despite shock |
| Medication history | Anticoagulants, beta-blockers |
| Mechanism | Low-energy falls can cause severe injury |

#### Emergency Department
| Assessment | Details |
|------------|---------|
| Trauma protocol | Early activation recommended |
| Vital sign interpretation | Consider medication effects |
| Imaging | Liberal use of CT scanning |
| Laboratory | Include coagulation studies |

### Medication Considerations

#### Anticoagulation/Antiplatelet
| Issue | Management |
|-------|------------|
| Bleeding risk | Assess and reverse as appropriate |
| Intracranial hemorrhage | Low threshold for imaging |
| Reversal agents | Prothrombin complex concentrate, idarucizumab |
| Antiplatelet | Platelet transfusion if major bleeding |

#### Beta-Blockers
| Concern | Consideration |
|---------|---------------|
| Blunted tachycardia | May mask hypovolemia |
| Interpretation | Cannot rely on heart rate for shock assessment |
| Continuation | Generally continue unless contraindicated |

### Specific Injuries

#### Traumatic Brain Injury
| Aspect | Recommendation |
|--------|----------------|
| Imaging threshold | Low threshold for CT head |
| Anticoagulation reversal | Prompt reversal if intracranial hemorrhage |
| Monitoring | Close neurological observation |
| Outcomes | Age-related decline in outcomes |

#### Spinal Injuries
| Aspect | Recommendation |
|--------|----------------|
| Cervical spine | Low threshold for imaging |
| Central cord syndrome | More common in elderly |
| Surgical timing | Case-by-case decision |
| Osteoporosis | Higher fracture risk |

#### Chest Trauma
| Aspect | Recommendation |
|--------|----------------|
| Rib fractures | More complications than younger patients |
| Pain management | Multimodal approach essential |
| Pulmonary toilet | Aggressive respiratory care |
| Epidural analgesia | Consider for multiple rib fractures |

#### Abdominal Trauma
| Aspect | Recommendation |
|--------|----------------|
| Nonoperative management | May be appropriate but monitor closely |
| Surgical decision | Consider physiologic age |
| Damage control | Consider in unstable patients |

#### Orthopedic Injuries
| Injury Type | Consideration |
|-------------|---------------|
| Hip fractures | Early surgical fixation when possible |
| Pelvic fractures | Higher mortality than younger patients |
| Timing | Balance early surgery vs optimization |

### Pain Management

#### Principles
| Recommendation | Details |
|----------------|---------|
| Multimodal approach | Reduce opioid reliance |
| Opioid caution | Start low, go slow |
| Regional anesthesia | Consider nerve blocks, epidurals |
| Assessment | Use age-appropriate pain scales |

#### Specific Agents
| Agent | Consideration |
|-------|---------------|
| Acetaminophen | First-line, max 3g/day in elderly |
| NSAIDs | Use cautiously; renal, GI, cardiac risks |
| Opioids | Reduced starting doses; monitor closely |
| Adjuvants | Gabapentinoids if neuropathic component |

### Infection Prevention

#### Antibiotic Prophylaxis
| Indication | Recommendation |
|------------|----------------|
| Penetrating abdominal trauma | Prophylaxis recommended |
| Penetrating thoracic trauma | Prophylaxis recommended |
| Severe burns | Prophylaxis recommended |
| Open fractures | Prophylaxis per standard protocols |

### Nutrition

#### Assessment
- Early nutritional status evaluation
- Screen for malnutrition
- Consider enteral nutrition early

### Goals of Care

#### Discussions
| Topic | Recommendation |
|-------|----------------|
| Early discussion | Incorporate patient/family wishes |
| Realistic expectations | Communicate prognosis |
| Advance directives | Review existing documents |
| Quality of life | Central to decision-making |

### Outcomes and Disposition

#### Considerations
| Factor | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Functional outcomes | Priority consideration |
| Rehabilitation | Early planning |
| Discharge planning | Multidisciplinary approach |
| Long-term care | Assess needs early |
