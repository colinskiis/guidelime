## Scope
Recommendation for annual screening for lung cancer with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) in adults at high risk based on age and smoking history.

## Recommendation

### Who Should Be Screened? (Grade: B)
The USPSTF recommends annual screening for lung cancer with LDCT in adults who meet **all** of the following criteria:
1.  **Age**: 50 to 80 years.
2.  **Smoking History**: 20 pack-year smoking history.
3.  **Current Status**: Currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years.

### When to Stop Screening?
Screening should be discontinued once a person:
- Has not smoked for 15 years.
- Develops a health problem that substantially limits life expectancy or the ability or willingness to have curative lung surgery.

## Key Implementation Considerations

### Screening Tool
- **Low-Dose CT (LDCT)**: The only recommended screening tool. Chest X-ray is NOT recommended for lung cancer screening.

### Shared Decision-Making
- Before screening starts, a discussion should occur regarding:
  - Potential benefits (reduced mortality).
  - Potential harms (false-positives, overdiagnosis, radiation exposure).
  - The importance of smoking cessation for current smokers.

### Smoking Cessation
- Screening is not a substitute for smoking cessation.
- All current smokers should be offered smoking cessation interventions.

### Facility Requirements
- Screening should be conducted in centers with experience in LDCT and a multidisciplinary team for follow-up of abnormal results.
