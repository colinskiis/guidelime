## Scope

Screening recommendations for colorectal cancer in asymptomatic adults, including age to begin screening, screening intervals, and acceptable screening modalities.

## Notes

Grade A recommendation for ages 50-75, Grade B for ages 45-49. Key change from 2016: lowered starting age from 50 to 45 years. Multiple screening options acceptable: colonoscopy every 10 years, FIT annually, stool DNA-FIT every 1-3 years, CT colonography every 5 years, or flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5-10 years.
