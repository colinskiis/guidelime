## Scope
2024 AAFP clinical practice guideline on the diagnosis and management of obesity in adult primary care.

## Key Recommendations

### Screening and Diagnosis
- **BMI**: Calculate BMI for all adults at preventive visits.
  - Overweight: BMI 25-29.9 kg/m².
  - Obesity Class I: BMI 30-34.9.
  - Obesity Class II: BMI 35-39.9.
  - Obesity Class III: BMI ≥40.
- Waist circumference may add risk information (>40 inches in men, >35 inches in women = increased cardiometabolic risk).

### Comprehensive Treatment Approach

#### Lifestyle Intervention (Cornerstone)
- Reduced-calorie diet (500-750 kcal/day deficit).
- Increased physical activity (150+ min/week moderate-intensity).
- Behavioral counseling with goal-setting, self-monitoring, and support.

#### Pharmacotherapy
- **Indicated for**: BMI ≥30, or BMI ≥27 with obesity-related comorbidity (hypertension, T2DM, dyslipidemia, OSA).
- **GLP-1 Receptor Agonists (Semaglutide, Liraglutide, Tirzepatide)**: First-line pharmacotherapy due to significant weight loss efficacy and CV/metabolic benefits.
- **Other Options**: Phentermine-topiramate, naltrexone-bupropion, orlistat. Select based on patient profile.
- Medications should be combined with lifestyle intervention.

#### Bariatric/Metabolic Surgery
- Consider for patients with BMI ≥40, or BMI ≥35 with obesity-related comorbidities.
- Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy are most common.
- Long-term follow-up and nutritional supplementation required.

### Chronic Disease Model
- Obesity is a chronic disease. Long-term management, not short-term "diets," is key.

### Addressing Bias
- Treat patients with respect. Avoid weight stigma.
