## Scope
New 2025 ACOEM guidance statement on integrating the principles of lifestyle medicine into routine occupational medicine consultations and workplace wellness programs.

## Key Recommendations

### Core Pillars of Lifestyle Medicine
Occupational medicine physicians should address the six interconnected pillars:
1. **Nutrition**: Counsel on a whole-food, plant-predominant diet.
2. **Physical Activity**: Encourage at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity and 2+ sessions of strength training per week.
3. **Sleep**: Screen for and address sleep disorders; target 7-9 hours of quality sleep per night.
4. **Stress Resilience**: Provide resources for stress management, including mindfulness and cognitive behavioral techniques.
5. **Avoidance of Risky Substances**: Integrate tobacco cessation and alcohol moderation into clinical encounters.
6. **Positive Social Connections**: Encourage social support in and out of the workplace.

### Integration into Occupational Medicine
- **Health Surveillance Exams**: Use periodic health evaluations as an opportunity to assess lifestyle risk factors and provide brief interventions.
- **Fitness-for-Duty**: Consider the impact of lifestyle factors on worker safety and functional capacity.
- **Return-to-Work**: Incorporate lifestyle optimization into rehabilitation and return-to-work plans.

### Workplace-Level Interventions
- **Wellness Programs**: Partner with employers to design and evaluate evidence-based wellness programs.
- **Policy & Environment**: Advocate for healthy work environments (e.g., access to healthy food, standing desks, smoke-free campuses).

### Documentation and Coding
- Familiarity with appropriate ICD-10 and CPT codes for lifestyle counseling services to support reimbursement for this care.
