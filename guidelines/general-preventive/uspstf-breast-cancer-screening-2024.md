## Scope

Screening recommendations for breast cancer in asymptomatic women including age to begin screening, screening intervals, and recommendations regarding dense breasts.

## Notes

Key change from 2016: lowered starting age from 50 to 40 years. Grade B recommendation for biennial mammography ages 40-74. Insufficient evidence for screening in women ≥75 years or for supplemental screening (ultrasound/MRI) in women with dense breasts.
