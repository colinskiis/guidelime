## Scope
The 12th edition of the ACSM's Guidelines for Exercise Testing and Prescription, the definitive resource for exercise science professionals and clinicians.

## Key Recommendations

### Physical Activity Guidelines for Adults
- **Aerobic Exercise**: 150-300 minutes of moderate-intensity OR 75-150 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity per week.
- **Resistance Training**: 2-3 days per week targeting all major muscle groups.
- **Flexibility**: Stretching exercises at least 2-3 days per week.
- **Neuromotor Exercise**: Balance and coordination training, especially for older adults.

### FITT-VP Principle
- **Frequency**: How often.
- **Intensity**: How hard.
- **Time**: Duration.
- **Type**: Mode of exercise.
- **Volume**: Total amount of exercise.
- **Progression**: Gradual advancement over time.

### Pre-Participation Health Screening
- Updated algorithm emphasizes current physical activity status and presence of symptoms or known disease, simplifying the screening process.

### Special Populations (New/Updated Sections)
- **Sex Differences**: Considerations for hormonal, physiological, and biomechanical differences.
- **Transgender and Gender Diverse Individuals**: Guidance on inclusive exercise testing and prescription.
- **Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection (SCAD)**: Specific recommendations for exercise after SCAD.
- **Pediatric Cardiac Conditions**: Safe and effective exercise for children with heart disease.

### Exercise Testing
- Standardized protocols for cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET), submaximal testing, and field assessments.
