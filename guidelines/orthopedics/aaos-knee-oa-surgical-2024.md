## Scope
2024 AAOS clinical practice guideline on the surgical management of knee osteoarthritis.

## Key Recommendations

### Indications for Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA)
- End-stage knee OA with significant symptoms (pain, functional limitation) refractory to non-operative management.
- Failure of conservative treatment: Weight loss, physical therapy, NSAIDs, injections, activity modification.
- Radiographic OA correlating with symptoms.

### Shared Decision-Making
- Discuss benefits (pain relief, improved function) and risks (infection, VTE, stiffness, revision).
- Optimize modifiable risk factors: BMI, diabetes control, smoking cessation, nutrition.

### Timing
- No specific age or BMI cutoff is an absolute contraindication.
- Avoid operating too early (may outlast implant lifespan) or too late (limited benefit if severe deconditioning).

### Surgical Options

#### Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA)
- Standard of care for tricompartmental OA.
- Excellent long-term outcomes; ~20-year implant survival.

#### Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty (UKA)
- Option for isolated medial or lateral compartment OA with intact ACL, correctable deformity, and BMI <40.
- Faster recovery but higher revision rate than TKA.

#### High Tibial Osteotomy (HTO)
- Consider for younger, active patients with isolated medial compartment OA and varus malalignment.
- Joint-preserving; delays TKA.

### Arthroscopy for OA
- **NOT recommended**: Arthroscopic debridement or lavage does not improve outcomes for degenerative knee OA.

### Perioperative Optimization
- VTE prophylaxis, antibiotic prophylaxis, multimodal pain management, early mobilization.

### Revision Surgery
- Reserved for implant failure, infection, instability, or persistent symptoms after appropriate workup.
