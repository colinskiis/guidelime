## Scope
Evidence-based recommendations for the nonarthroplasty treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee in adults (ages 17 and older).

## Key Recommendations

### Diagnosis

#### Clinical Criteria
- Knee pain
- Age >50 years
- Morning stiffness <30 minutes
- Crepitus on motion
- Bony tenderness or enlargement

#### Imaging
- Weight-bearing radiographs (AP, lateral, patellofemoral)
- Kellgren-Lawrence grading system
- MRI generally not required for diagnosis

### Strongly Recommended Treatments

#### Exercise/Physical Therapy (Strong)
- Low-impact aerobic exercise
- Quadriceps strengthening
- Range of motion exercises
- Land-based or aquatic programs effective

#### Weight Management (Strong)
- For BMI ≥25 kg/m²
- Target: 5% or more weight loss
- Improves pain and function

#### Oral NSAIDs (Strong)
- First-line pharmacotherapy
- Consider patient risk factors (GI, CV, renal)
- Topical NSAIDs alternative

#### Self-Management Education (Strong)
- Patient understanding of disease
- Activity modification
- Self-efficacy programs

### Moderately Recommended Treatments

#### Intra-Articular Corticosteroids (Moderate)
- Short-term symptomatic relief
- Reasonable for acute flares
- Effect typically lasts weeks to months

#### Topical NSAIDs (Moderate)
- For patients at GI/CV risk with oral NSAIDs
- May be less effective than oral

#### Acetaminophen (Moderate)
- If NSAIDs contraindicated
- Limited efficacy evidence
- Ceiling dose concerns

#### Patellar Taping/Bracing (Moderate)
- May provide symptomatic relief
- Particularly for patellofemoral OA

#### Walking Aids (Moderate)
- Cane in contralateral hand
- Reduces joint loading

### Limited Evidence Treatments

#### Intra-Articular Hyaluronic Acid (Limited)
- Conflicting evidence
- May be considered if other treatments fail
- Shared decision-making

#### Duloxetine (Limited)
- For chronic knee OA pain
- FDA-approved for musculoskeletal pain

### Treatments NOT Recommended

#### Glucosamine/Chondroitin (Strong Against)
- No clinically meaningful benefit
- Should not be prescribed

#### Lateral Wedge Insoles (Strong Against)
- No benefit demonstrated
- Not recommended for medial compartment OA

#### Platelet-Rich Plasma (Limited Against)
- Insufficient evidence to recommend
- Not supported for routine use

#### Stem Cell Injections (Limited Against)
- Insufficient evidence
- Not recommended outside of clinical trials

#### Acupuncture (Limited Against)
- Insufficient evidence of benefit

#### Arthroscopic Lavage/Debridement (Moderate Against)
- No benefit for isolated OA
- Not recommended

### Surgical Considerations (Non-Arthroplasty)

#### Osteotomy
- May be considered in younger, active patients
- Appropriate alignment correction
- Unicompartmental disease

#### When to Refer for Arthroplasty
- Failed conservative management
- Significant functional limitation
- Radiographic end-stage disease
- Night pain disturbing sleep

### Treatment Algorithm
1. Education and self-management
2. Exercise and weight management
3. First-line pharmacotherapy (NSAIDs)
4. Physical therapy
5. Intra-articular injections
6. Consider surgical referral if conservative measures fail
