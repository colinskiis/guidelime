## Scope
Updated global consensus statement (Amsterdam 6th edition) providing a comprehensive framework for the prevention, identification, and management of sport-related concussion (SRC) across all levels of athletic participation.

## Key Recommendations

### Definition and Identification
- **Definition**: SRC is defined as a traumatic brain injury induced by biomechanical forces. It may be caused by a direct blow to the head, face, neck, or elsewhere on the body with an impulsive force transmitted to the head.
- **Tools**: Recommends the use of the **SCAT6** (Sport Concussion Assessment Tool 6) for adolescents (≥13 years) and adults, and the **Child SCAT6** for ages 5-12 years.

### Initial Management
- **Immediate Removal**: Any athlete with a suspected concussion must be immediately removed from play and should not return to play on the same day.
- **Medical Evaluation**: A comprehensive evaluation by a healthcare professional is required to rule out more serious TBI or cervical spine injury.

### Rehabilitation and Recovery
- **Relative Rest**: Recommends a brief period (24-48 hours) of physical and cognitive rest, followed by a gradual increase in activity that does not significantly exacerbate symptoms.
- **Early Active Recovery**: Sub-symptom threshold aerobic exercise (e.g., brisk walking, light stationary cycling) can be started as early as 48 hours post-injury to promote recovery.

### Return to Learn and Play
- **Step-wise Progression**:
  1. **Return to Learn**: Prioritize returning to the classroom before returning to full sports.
  2. **Return to Sport**: A 6-step gradual progression starting with light activity, then sport-specific exercise, non-contact drills, full contact practice, and finally return to game play.
- **Symptom Resolution**: Athletes should be asymptomatic (off medications) before advancing to full-contact drills.

### Long-term Considerations
- **Persistent Symptoms**: If symptoms persist beyond 4 weeks, a formal multi-disciplinary evaluation is recommended (including vestibulo-ocular, cervical, and psychological assessment).
- **Retirement from Sport**: Decisions regarding retirement should be individualized and involve a multi-disciplinary team, considering the number of concussions, duration of recovery, and structural imaging.

### Prevention
- **Rule Changes**: Support for policy changes (e.g., limiting checking in youth hockey) to reduce concussion risk.
- **Equipment**: While helmets prevent skull fractures and severe TBI, there is limited evidence they prevent SRC. Mouthguards have shown some benefit in certain sports.
