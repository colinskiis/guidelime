## Scope

This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for the treatment of symptomatic osteoarthritis of the hip in adults.

## Key Recommendations

### Nonpharmacologic Treatment
**Strong Recommendations:**
- Physical therapy and therapeutic exercise
- Weight management (if overweight/obese)

**Moderate Recommendations:**
- Low-impact aerobic exercise
- Assistive devices (canes used in contralateral hand)
- Patient education and self-management

### Pharmacologic Treatment
**Strong Recommendations:**
- Oral NSAIDs (with GI and CV risk assessment)
- Topical NSAIDs as adjunct

**Moderate Recommendations:**
- Acetaminophen for patients with NSAID contraindications
- Duloxetine for chronic pain management

**Not Recommended or Inconclusive:**
- Intra-articular corticosteroids: Limited evidence of long-term benefit
- Hyaluronic acid injections: Not recommended
- PRP: Insufficient evidence
- Glucosamine/chondroitin: Not recommended

### Surgical Treatment
**Strong Recommendations:**
- Total hip arthroplasty for patients with significant pain and functional limitations who have failed nonsurgical treatment
- Preoperative optimization (cardiac, nutritional, HbA1c control)

**Moderate Recommendations:**
- Anterior approach associated with faster early recovery (but similar long-term outcomes)
- Outpatient THA appropriate for selected patients

### Preoperative Considerations
- Smoking cessation
- Diabetes optimization (HbA1c <8%)
- Anemia correction
- Malnutrition screening

### Postoperative Care
- Early mobilization
- VTE prophylaxis
- Physical therapy
