## Scope
2024 AAOS clinical practice guideline on the evaluation and management of hip fractures in patients ≥65 years.

## Key Recommendations

### Early Surgical Treatment
- **Surgery Within 24-48 Hours**: Strongly recommended if medically stable. Reduces mortality, complications, and length of stay.
- Delay only for unstable medical conditions requiring optimization.

### Surgical Options

#### Femoral Neck Fractures
- **Non-Displaced**: Internal fixation (cannulated screws, sliding hip screw).
- **Displaced**: Arthroplasty preferred.
  - **Hemiarthroplasty**: For less active patients or limited life expectancy.
  - **Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA)**: For cognitively intact, independently ambulatory patients.

#### Intertrochanteric Fractures
- **Cephalomedullary Nail (Intramedullary Hip Screw)**: Preferred for most patterns.
- **Sliding Hip Screw (SHS)**: Alternative for stable fracture patterns.

### Anesthesia
- Regional (spinal) anesthesia may be associated with improved outcomes compared to general anesthesia; shared decision-making.

### VTE Prophylaxis
- Mechanical prophylaxis (IPC) + pharmacological prophylaxis (LMWH, fondaparinux, DOACs, or aspirin) recommended.
- Duration: At least 10-14 days; consider extended prophylaxis up to 35 days.

### Perioperative Care
- Multidisciplinary geriatric co-management (orthogeriatrics) improves outcomes.
- Early mobilization, pain control, delirium prevention.

### Osteoporosis Management
- Initiate osteoporosis treatment after hip fracture.
- Calcium, vitamin D, bisphosphonate or denosumab.
- Fracture liaison service referral.

### Medical Optimization
- Address anticoagulation reversal, anemia, hydration, cardiac risk stratification expeditiously to avoid surgical delay.
