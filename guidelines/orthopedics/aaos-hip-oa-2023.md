## Scope
Evidence-based recommendations for the non-operative management of hip osteoarthritis in adults.

## Key Recommendations

### Diagnosis

#### Clinical Features
- Hip or groin pain
- Stiffness, especially morning stiffness <30 minutes
- Reduced range of motion
- Functional limitations

#### Imaging
- Weight-bearing AP pelvis radiograph
- Look for: Joint space narrowing, osteophytes, subchondral sclerosis, cysts
- Advanced imaging rarely needed for diagnosis

### Non-Pharmacologic Treatment

#### Exercise (Strong Recommendation)
- Therapeutic exercise programs recommended
- Land-based and aquatic exercise both beneficial
- Should include strengthening and ROM exercises
- Physical therapy referral appropriate

#### Weight Management (Strong Recommendation)
- Weight loss recommended for overweight/obese patients
- Even modest weight loss (5-10%) can reduce symptoms
- Combined diet and exercise most effective

#### Patient Education
- Self-management programs recommended
- Understanding disease nature and prognosis
- Activity modification strategies

#### Assistive Devices
- Cane or walking stick for support
- Use in contralateral hand
- May reduce joint loading

### Pharmacologic Treatment

#### Oral NSAIDs (Strong Recommendation)
- Recommended for symptomatic relief
- Consider GI and cardiovascular risks
- Use lowest effective dose for shortest duration

#### Topical NSAIDs (Moderate Recommendation)
- Alternative to oral NSAIDs
- Fewer systemic side effects
- May be less effective for deep hip joint

#### Acetaminophen
- Limited evidence for efficacy
- May be considered for patients unable to take NSAIDs
- Maximum 3g/day; caution with liver disease

#### Duloxetine (Moderate Recommendation)
- May be considered for chronic hip OA pain
- Particularly if neuropathic pain component
- Start low and titrate

### Intra-Articular Injections

#### Corticosteroids (Moderate Recommendation)
- Short-term pain relief
- Consider for acute flares
- Limit frequency (generally ≤3-4 per year)
- Ultrasound guidance may improve accuracy

#### Hyaluronic Acid
- Limited evidence for hip OA
- Less studied than in knee OA
- May be considered if other treatments fail

#### Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP)
- Insufficient evidence for routine use
- Consider in context of shared decision-making

### Treatments NOT Recommended

#### Glucosamine/Chondroitin (Strong Against)
- No evidence of benefit over placebo
- Not recommended

#### Lateral Wedge Insoles
- Not recommended for hip OA

### Indications for Surgery Referral
- Inadequate response to non-operative treatment
- Significant functional limitation
- Night pain disturbing sleep
- Radiographic evidence of severe OA

### Surgical Options
- Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is definitive treatment
- Discuss timing based on symptoms and function
- Preoperative optimization (weight, comorbidities)

### Monitoring
- Periodic reassessment of symptoms and function
- Adjust treatment as needed
- Screen for progression requiring surgical intervention
