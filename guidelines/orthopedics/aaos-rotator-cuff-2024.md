## Scope
2024 AAOS clinical practice guideline on the surgical management of symptomatic rotator cuff tears in adults.

## Key Recommendations

### Indications for Surgery
- Symptomatic full-thickness rotator cuff tears refractory to non-operative management (physical therapy, NSAIDs, corticosteroid injections).
- Acute traumatic tears, especially in younger or active patients, may benefit from earlier surgical intervention.
- Consider patient factors: age, activity level, tear size, muscle atrophy, fatty infiltration.

### Timing of Surgery
- For acute, traumatic tears in active patients, earlier repair (within 3-6 months) may improve outcomes.
- Chronic, degenerative tears may be managed conservatively initially; proceed to surgery if symptoms persist.

### Surgical Approach
- **Arthroscopic Repair**: Preferred technique for most rotator cuff tears due to reduced morbidity, improved visualization, and comparable outcomes to open repair.
- **Open or Mini-Open Repair**: May be used for large or massive tears, revision surgery, or surgeon preference.

### Partial-Thickness Tears
- Management depends on tear depth (>50% depth is more likely to benefit from completion and repair) and symptoms.
- Options include debridement, completion and repair, or conservative management.

### Adjuncts
- **Biologic Augmentation (PRP, Patches, Scaffolds)**: Limited evidence for routine use. May be considered in select cases.
- **Subacromial Decompression**: May be performed concurrently if there is evidence of impingement; not universally required.

### Postoperative Rehabilitation
- Structured physical therapy is essential.
- Early passive ROM followed by progressive strengthening over 3-6 months.

### Outcomes
- Most patients achieve significant pain reduction and functional improvement after rotator cuff repair.
- Re-tear rates depend on tear size, patient age, and tissue quality.
