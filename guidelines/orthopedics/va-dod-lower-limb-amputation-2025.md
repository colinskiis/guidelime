## Scope
Comprehensive evidence-based recommendations for a multi-disciplinary approach to the rehabilitation of individuals with lower limb amputation, focusing on maximizing function, health, and quality of life.

## Key Recommendations

### Multi-disciplinary Care
- **Team Approach**: Rehabilitation must be managed by a team including a physiatrist or orthopedic surgeon, prosthetist, physical therapist, occupational therapist, and mental health professional.
- **Coordination**: Regular team communication is essential to ensure consistent goals and progress monitoring.

### Pre-operative and Acute Post-operative Care
- **Pre-surgical Consultation**: If possible, involve the physical therapist and prosthetist before surgery to discuss expectations and post-operative mobility.
- **Residual Limb Management**: Recommends the use of rigid or semi-rigid dressings (rather than soft dressings alone) to control edema and facilitate earlier prosthetic fitting.

### Prosthetic Prescription and Training
- **Componentry**: Choice of prosthetic components (e.g., knee units, feet) should be based on the individual's current and potential activity level (K-levels).
- **Gait Training**: Intensive prosthetic gait training by a physical therapist is strongly recommended to optimize mobility and reduce the risk of secondary musculoskeletal issues.

### Pain Management
- **Phantom Limb Pain**: Recommends a multi-modal approach including mirror therapy, graded motor imagery, and pharmacological management (e.g., gabapentinoids if indicated).
- **Residual Limb Pain**: Meticulous evaluation for musculoskeletal causes (e.g., bursa, neuroma) or prosthetic fit issues.

### Psychological and Social Support
- **Screening**: All patients should be screened for depression, anxiety, and PTSD, which are common following limb loss.
- **Social Integration**: Encourage participation in peer support groups and adaptive sports/recreation to improve long-term adjustment.

### Health Maintenance
- **Long-term Follow-up**: At least annual follow-up with the prosthetic and rehabilitation team to monitor prosthetic fit, skin integrity, and overall functional status.
- **Cardiovascular Health**: Emphasize smoking cessation and management of comorbid conditions (e.g., diabetes) that may lead to further limb loss.
