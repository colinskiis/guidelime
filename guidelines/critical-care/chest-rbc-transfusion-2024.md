## Scope
2024 CHEST guideline providing evidence-based recommendations for red blood cell (RBC) transfusion thresholds and strategies in critically ill adult patients.

## Key Recommendations

### General Principle: Restrictive Transfusion Strategy
- **Recommendation**: A restrictive transfusion strategy (transfuse when hemoglobin [Hb] <7 g/dL) is recommended for most hemodynamically stable, critically ill adults.
- **Rationale**: Multiple randomized trials (e.g., TRICC, TRISS) demonstrate that a restrictive strategy is as safe as, and may be associated with lower mortality than, a liberal strategy (Hb <10 g/dL).

### Specific Populations
- **Sepsis and Septic Shock**: A restrictive threshold (Hb <7 g/dL) is recommended (TRISS trial).
- **Acute Coronary Syndromes (ACS)**: A more liberal threshold (Hb <8-10 g/dL) may be considered, though evidence is less definitive. The REALITY trial suggests that a restrictive strategy is non-inferior.
- **Acute GI Bleeding**: A restrictive threshold (Hb <7 g/dL) is generally recommended for upper GI bleeding in hemodynamically stable patients.
- **Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)**: Data are limited. Individualize based on clinical status and cerebral oxygenation.

### Active Hemorrhage
- In patients with ongoing, uncontrolled hemorrhage, transfuse to maintain hemodynamic stability and adequate oxygen delivery. Numerical thresholds are less relevant than clinical resuscitation goals.

### Transfusion Reactions and Risks
- RBC transfusion carries risks including TACO (transfusion-associated circulatory overload), TRALI (transfusion-related acute lung injury), and febrile/allergic reactions.

### Single-Unit Transfusion
- For stable patients without ongoing bleeding, transfusing one unit at a time and reassessing is recommended.
