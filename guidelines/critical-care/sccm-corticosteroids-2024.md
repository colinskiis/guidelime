## Scope
2024 focused update from SCCM and ESICM on the role of corticosteroids in sepsis, septic shock, ARDS, and severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).

## Key Recommendations

### Septic Shock
- **Recommendation**: For adults with septic shock that is refractory to fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy (e.g., requiring norepinephrine ≥0.25 mcg/kg/min for >4 hours), low-dose IV hydrocortisone (200 mg/day as continuous infusion or 50 mg IV q6h) is **conditionally recommended**.
- **Rationale**: May hasten shock reversal and vasopressor discontinuation. Mortality benefit is less consistent across trials.

### Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)
- **Recommendation**: For adults with moderate-to-severe ARDS (P/F ratio <200) early in the disease course (<14 days), corticosteroids (e.g., dexamethasone 20mg IV daily or equivalent) are **conditionally recommended**.
- **Evidence**: Strong evidence from COVID-19 (RECOVERY trial) and non-COVID ARDS (DEXA-ARDS trial) showing reduced mortality and ventilator-free days.

### Severe Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP)
- **Recommendation**: For hospitalized adults with severe CAP and high inflammatory markers (e.g., CRP >150 mg/L), corticosteroids are **conditionally recommended** to reduce treatment failure, length of stay, and potentially mortality.
- **Agent/Dose**: Hydrocortisone 200 mg/day or methylprednisolone 0.5 mg/kg/day for 5-7 days.

### General Considerations
- **Duration**: Therapy duration is typically 5-7 days, with gradual tapering if used for >5-7 days to avoid rebound inflammation.
- **Hyperglycemia**: Increased monitoring and insulin therapy may be required during corticosteroid administration.
