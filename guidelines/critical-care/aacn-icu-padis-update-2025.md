## Scope
Focused update expanding the 2018 PADIS guidelines with new evidence specifically addressing the pharmacologic management of agitation/sedation and sleep, and the nonpharmacologic management of immobility.

## Key Recommendations

### Agitation and Sedation
- **Targeted Sedation**: Reaffirms the use of light sedation (RASS -1 to 0) as the default for most mechanically ventilated patients.
- **Dexmedetomidine**: Recommended over benzodiazepines for sedation in patients where shorter duration of mechanical ventilation and lower delirium rates are prioritized.
- **Propofol**: Remains a primary option for rapid-onset and rapid-offset sedation.

### Sleep Disruption
- **Melatonin/Ramelteon**: Inconclusive evidence for routine use to improve sleep quality in the ICU; clinicians may consider on a case-by-case basis based on patient preference and low risk of harm.
- **Sleep Hygiene**: Multicomponent non-pharmacologic sleep protocols (e.g., earplugs, eye masks, clustered nursing care) are strongly recommended.

### Immobility and Early Mobilization
- **Early Mobility**: Strong recommendation to initiate physical and occupational therapy early in the ICU stay (within 48-72 hours) for stable patients.
- **Safety**: Monitoring and pre-defined safety criteria should be used to guide mobilization activities.
- **Outcomes**: Associated with improved functional status at discharge and shorter ICU/hospital length of stay.

### Integrated Approach (the ABCDEF Bundle)
- Management of PADIS elements should be integrated through the **ABCDEF bundle**:
  - **A**: Assess, prevent, and manage pain.
  - **B**: Both Spontaneous Awakening Trials (SAT) and Spontaneous Breathing Trials (SBT).
  - **C**: Choice of analgesia and sedation.
  - **D**: Delirium: assess, prevent, and manage.
  - **E**: Early mobility and exercise.
  - **F**: Family engagement and empowerment.
