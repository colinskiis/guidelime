## Scope
2024 update to the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) international guidelines on the management of sepsis and septic shock in adults.

## Key Recommendations

### Screening and Diagnosis
- Implement systematic screening for sepsis in acute care settings.
- Use clinical criteria (suspected/confirmed infection + organ dysfunction, e.g., SOFA score ≥2).

### Hour-1 Bundle (To Be Initiated Immediately Upon Sepsis Recognition)
1. **Measure Lactate**: If lactate >2 mmol/L, repeat to guide resuscitation.
2. **Obtain Blood Cultures**: Before antibiotics if it does not significantly delay treatment.
3. **Administer Broad-Spectrum Antibiotics**: Target within 1 hour of sepsis recognition. Earlier is better.
4. **Fluid Resuscitation**: Administer 30 mL/kg crystalloid for hypotension or lactate ≥4 mmol/L within the first 3 hours.
5. **Vasopressors**: If hypotension persists during or after fluid resuscitation, start vasopressors to target MAP ≥65 mmHg. Norepinephrine is first-line.

### Fluid Therapy
- Crystalloids (balanced solutions preferred over 0.9% saline) are first choice.
- Avoid hydroxyethyl starch (HES).
- Reassess fluid responsiveness; avoid fluid overload.

### Vasopressors and Inotropes
- **Norepinephrine**: First-line vasopressor.
- **Vasopressin**: Add if inadequate response to norepinephrine.
- **Epinephrine**: May be added.
- **Dobutamine**: For persistent hypoperfusion despite adequate MAP and volume status (cardiac dysfunction).

### Corticosteroids
- Consider IV hydrocortisone (200 mg/day) for patients with septic shock refractory to fluids and vasopressors.

### Source Control
- Identify and control the source of infection (e.g., drain abscess, remove infected device) as rapidly as possible.

### De-escalation
- Narrow antibiotic therapy based on culture results.
- Procalcitonin-guided duration may reduce exposure.
