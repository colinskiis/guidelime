## Scope
2024 SCCM/ATS clinical practice guideline update on mechanical ventilation strategies for adults with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

## Key Recommendations

### Lung-Protective Ventilation (Strongly Recommended)
- **Low Tidal Volume**: 4-8 mL/kg predicted body weight (target 6 mL/kg).
- **Plateau Pressure**: Keep <30 cm H2O.
- **Driving Pressure**: Target ≤15 cm H2O (Pplat - PEEP).

### PEEP
- Use higher PEEP strategy in moderate-to-severe ARDS to improve oxygenation and reduce atelectrauma.
- Individualize PEEP titration; recruitment maneuvers may be considered but use with caution.

### Prone Positioning (Strongly Recommended)
- **Prone ventilation ≥12-16 hours/day** for moderate-to-severe ARDS (PaO2/FiO2 <150).
- Improves oxygenation and reduces mortality.

### Neuromuscular Blockade (Conditional Recommendation)
- Early continuous infusion of neuromuscular blocking agents (e.g., cisatracurium) may be considered for severe ARDS (P/F <150) in the first 48 hours.
- Used in conjunction with deep sedation.

### Conservative Fluid Strategy
- After initial resuscitation, target conservative fluid balance to minimize pulmonary edema and shorten ventilator days.

### Corticosteroids
- Consider dexamethasone or methylprednisolone in early moderate-to-severe ARDS to reduce inflammation and mortality (based on DEXA-ARDS, COVID-19 studies).

### ECMO
- Veno-venous ECMO may be considered for refractory hypoxemia (P/F <80 despite optimal ventilation and prone positioning) in experienced centers.

### Avoid
- High tidal volumes.
- Frequent disconnection from ventilator.
- Excessive driving pressures.
