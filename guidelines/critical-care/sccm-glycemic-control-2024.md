## Scope
Updated 2024 SCCM guideline for the management of glucose levels in critically ill adult patients.

## Key Recommendations

### Blood Glucose Targets
- **Target Range**: Recommends maintaining blood glucose between **140-180 mg/dL** for most critically ill patients.
- **Avoid Tight Control (<110 mg/dL)**: Tight glycemic control (<110 mg/dL) is discouraged due to the increased risk of severe hypoglycemia, which is associated with increased mortality.

### Insulin Therapy
- **Intravenous Insulin Infusion**: Preferred for patients in the ICU requiring glycemic control, as it allows for rapid titration.
- **Validated Protocols**: The use of validated, nurse-driven protocols is strongly recommended to minimize variability and hypoglycemia.

### Monitoring
- **Frequent Blood Glucose Monitoring**: Recommends point-of-care blood glucose testing every 1-2 hours initially, and at least every 4 hours once stable within the target range.
- **Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM)**: May be considered as an adjunct but should not replace confirmatory blood glucose testing, particularly when making treatment decisions.

### Hypoglycemia
- **Definition and Treatment**: Hypoglycemia (<70 mg/dL) should be treated promptly with IV dextrose.
- **Prevention**: Ensure adequate nutrition and proactive adjustment of insulin infusion when enteral or parenteral nutrition is interrupted.

### Transition to Subcutaneous Insulin
- Begin transition from IV to subcutaneous insulin when the patient is hemodynamically stable and tolerating enteral nutrition.
