## Scope
Focused update to the 2018 PADIS guidelines with new recommendations for management of anxiety (new topic), agitation/sedation, delirium, immobility, and sleep disruption in critically ill adults.

## Key Recommendations

### Overview

#### ABCDEF Bundle Integration
| Element | Component |
|---------|-----------|
| A | Assess, prevent, and manage pain |
| B | Both spontaneous awakening and breathing trials |
| C | Choice of analgesia and sedation |
| D | Delirium: assess, prevent, manage |
| E | Early mobility and exercise |
| F | Family engagement and empowerment |

#### Impact
- 68% decreased likelihood of hospital death within 7 days
- Proven in studies involving >20,000 patients

### Pain Management

#### Assessment
| Recommendation | Details |
|----------------|---------|
| Valid tools | BPS, CPOT for non-verbal patients |
| Routine assessment | Regular intervals |
| Patient self-report | Gold standard when possible |

#### Treatment Approach
| Strategy | Details |
|----------|---------|
| Analgesia-first | Before sedation |
| Multimodal | Opioid-sparing approaches |
| Non-pharmacologic | Consider adjuncts |

### Anxiety (New Topic in 2025)

#### Assessment
| Recommendation | Details |
|----------------|---------|
| Validated tools | Suggest use for anxiety assessment |
| Benzodiazepines | Insufficient evidence for recommendation |

#### Management
| Intervention | Recommendation |
|--------------|----------------|
| Nonpharmacologic | Consider as first-line |
| Music therapy | Shows potential benefit |
| Virtual reality | Emerging evidence |
| Pharmacologic | No specific recommendation currently |

### Agitation and Sedation

#### Sedation Depth
| Recommendation | Details |
|----------------|---------|
| Light sedation | Preferred over deep sedation |
| Target RASS | 0 to -2 for most patients |
| Daily awakening | Spontaneous awakening trials |

#### Medication Selection (2025 Update)
| Comparison | Recommendation |
|------------|----------------|
| Dexmedetomidine vs propofol | Suggest dexmedetomidine when light sedation or delirium reduction are priorities |
| Dexmedetomidine vs benzodiazepines | Prefer dexmedetomidine or propofol over benzodiazepines |

#### Specific Agent Considerations
| Agent | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| Dexmedetomidine | Cooperative sedation, less delirium |
| Propofol | Rapid on/off, hypotension risk |
| Benzodiazepines | Avoid; associated with worse outcomes |

### Delirium

#### Risk Factors
| Modifiable | Non-modifiable |
|------------|----------------|
| Benzodiazepine use | Advanced age |
| Blood transfusions | Dementia |
| Deep sedation | Prior coma |
| Immobility | Emergency surgery/trauma |

#### Assessment
| Recommendation | Details |
|----------------|---------|
| Validated tools | CAM-ICU, ICDSC |
| Frequency | At least once per shift |
| Documentation | Required |

#### Prevention
| Strategy | Details |
|----------|---------|
| Avoid benzodiazepines | Strong recommendation |
| Early mobilization | Recommended |
| Sleep promotion | Address sleep disruption |
| Reorientation | Frequent orientation cues |
| Sensory aids | Glasses, hearing aids |

#### Treatment (2025 Update)
| Intervention | Recommendation |
|--------------|----------------|
| Antipsychotics | No recommendation for or against |
| Haloperidol | Minimal or no effect on outcomes |
| Atypical antipsychotics | Similar findings |
| Nonpharmacologic | Continue delirium prevention strategies |

### Immobility (2025 Update)

#### Mobilization
| Recommendation | Details |
|----------------|---------|
| Enhanced mobilization | Suggest over usual care |
| Early initiation | As soon as safely possible |
| Progressive approach | Based on patient status |
| PT/OT involvement | Multidisciplinary team |

#### Safety Considerations
| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Hemodynamic stability | Required before mobilization |
| Airway security | Ensure before activity |
| Line/tube security | Assess before movement |
| Adequate staffing | Ensure for safety |

### Sleep Disruption (2025 Update)

#### Assessment
| Recommendation | Details |
|----------------|---------|
| Sleep quality | Assess regularly |
| Sleep disruption | Identify contributing factors |
| Sleep hygiene | Implement protocols |

#### Environmental Modifications
| Intervention | Details |
|--------------|---------|
| Light reduction | Minimize nighttime light |
| Noise reduction | Quiet hours protocols |
| Clustering care | Minimize nighttime interruptions |
| Day/night cycles | Maintain circadian rhythms |

#### Melatonin (2025 Update)
| Recommendation | Details |
|----------------|---------|
| Melatonin use | Suggest as low-risk intervention |
| Benefits | May improve sleep quality |
| Delirium | May help reduce delirium |
| Evidence | 30 RCTs now available (vs 3 in 2018) |

### Family Engagement

#### Recommendations
| Element | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Family presence | Encourage when possible |
| Communication | Regular updates |
| Participation | Involve in care decisions |
| Support | Provide resources |

### Implementation

#### Bundle Approach
| Strategy | Details |
|----------|---------|
| All elements | Implement as coordinated bundle |
| Daily assessment | Each component addressed |
| Documentation | Track compliance |
| Quality improvement | Monitor outcomes |
