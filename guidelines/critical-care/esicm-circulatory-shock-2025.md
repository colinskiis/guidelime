## Scope
Comprehensive evidence-based update for the diagnosis, monitoring, and management of circulatory shock in adult intensive care patients, emphasizing individualized hemodynamic targets and the proactive use of advanced monitoring.

## Key Recommendations

### Diagnosis and Monitoring
- **Shock Definition**: Defined as a state of cellular dysoxia due to inadequate oxygen delivery and/or utilization.
- **Lactate**: Recommends serial lactate measurement to monitor the adequacy of resuscitation and identify patients at risk of worsening shock.
- **Physical Exam**: Emphasizes the value of simple bedside markers (e.g., capillary refill time, mottling score) as indicators of skin hypoperfusion.

### Hemodynamic Targets
- **Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP)**: Recommends an initial target MAP of at least 65 mmHg.
- **Personalized MAP**: Recommends considering higher MAP targets (e.g., 75–80 mmHg) for patients with prior chronic hypertension to maintain autoregulation and organ perfusion.

### Fluid Management
- **Fluid Responsiveness**: Strongly recommends using dynamic indices (e.g., passive leg raise, stroke volume variation) rather than static markers (e.g., CVP) to predict fluid responsiveness.
- **Balanced Crystalloids**: Preferred over saline (0.9% NaCl) for initial fluid resuscitation to reduce the risk of hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis and renal injury.

### Vasoactive Agents
- **Norepinephrine**: Remains the first-line vasopressor for undifferentiated and septic shock.
- **Vasopressin**: Recommended as an early add-on to norepinephrine for septic shock to spare norepinephrine dose and potentially improve renal outcomes.
- **Inotropes (Dobutamine)**: Recommended for patients with persistent hypoperfusion despite adequate volume and MAP, particularly if myocardial dysfunction is present.

### Advanced Monitoring
- **Echocardiography**: Recommends early and repeated focused cardiac ultrasound to assess cardiac function and guide therapy.
- **Invasive Monitoring**: Recommends pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) or transpulmonary thermodilution in complex, refractory shock cases to measure cardiac output and extravascular lung water.

### Specialized Scenarios
- **Septic Shock**: Focus on early antibiotic administration (within 1 hour) and source control.
- **Cardiogenic Shock**: Emphasis on rapid revascularization (if indicated) and consideration of mechanical circulatory support in specialized centers.
