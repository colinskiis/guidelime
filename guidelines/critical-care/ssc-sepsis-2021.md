## Scope
Evidence-based international guidelines for the management of sepsis and septic shock in adults, endorsed by 24 international societies.

## Key Recommendations

### Screening and Early Recognition

#### Recommendations
| Element | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Screening | Implement performance improvement programs |
| Recognition | Routine screening for sepsis |
| Standard operating procedures | For sepsis identification |
| Lactate | Measure if sepsis suspected |

### Initial Resuscitation

#### Hour-1 Bundle Elements
| Element | Recommendation |
|---------|----------------|
| Lactate measurement | Measure; remeasure if elevated |
| Blood cultures | Before antibiotics when possible |
| Broad-spectrum antibiotics | Within 1 hour of recognition |
| IV fluid | 30 mL/kg crystalloid for hypotension or lactate ≥4 |
| Vasopressors | If hypotensive during or after fluid resuscitation |

#### Fluid Resuscitation
| Recommendation | Details |
|----------------|---------|
| Initial bolus | 30 mL/kg crystalloid within first 3 hours |
| Reassessment | Dynamic measures of fluid responsiveness |
| Crystalloid preferred | Over colloids for initial resuscitation |
| Balanced crystalloids | Suggest over normal saline |
| Albumin | Consider if substantial crystalloid given |
| Avoid hydroxyethyl starch | Strong recommendation |

### Mean Arterial Pressure Target

#### Recommendation
| Target | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Initial MAP | ≥65 mmHg |
| Individualization | Consider patient factors |
| Higher targets | Not routinely recommended |

### Vasopressors

#### First-Line
| Agent | Recommendation |
|-------|----------------|
| Norepinephrine | First-line vasopressor (strong) |
| Route | Central line preferred; peripheral acceptable initially |

#### Second-Line Options
| Situation | Agent |
|-----------|-------|
| Inadequate MAP on norepinephrine | Add vasopressin |
| Cardiac dysfunction | Consider adding dobutamine |
| Alternative | Epinephrine |
| Avoid | Dopamine (except bradycardia) |

### Antimicrobial Therapy

#### Timing
| Scenario | Timing |
|----------|--------|
| Septic shock | Within 1 hour (strong) |
| Sepsis without shock | Within 3 hours |
| High probability of sepsis | Ideally within 1 hour |

#### Spectrum and Selection
| Recommendation | Details |
|----------------|---------|
| Broad-spectrum | Initially cover likely pathogens |
| Empiric coverage | Based on source, local resistance |
| Reassessment | Daily for de-escalation |
| Duration | 7-10 days for most infections |
| Procalcitonin | Can guide duration (weak) |

### Source Control

#### Recommendations
| Element | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Identification | Rapidly identify infectious source |
| Intervention | As soon as medically and logistically practical |
| Timing | Within 6-12 hours of diagnosis |
| Device removal | Remove intravascular devices if source |

### Mechanical Ventilation

#### ARDS Management
| Recommendation | Details |
|----------------|---------|
| Low tidal volume | 6 mL/kg predicted body weight |
| Plateau pressure | Target ≤30 cm H2O |
| PEEP | Higher PEEP strategy for moderate-severe ARDS |
| Prone positioning | For PaO2/FiO2 <150 |
| Recruitment maneuvers | Not routinely recommended |
| Neuromuscular blockade | Not routine; consider if PaO2/FiO2 <150 |

### Corticosteroids

#### Recommendations
| Scenario | Recommendation |
|----------|----------------|
| Refractory shock | Suggest IV hydrocortisone 200 mg/day |
| Ongoing vasopressor need | Despite adequate resuscitation |
| Duration | Until shock resolves |

### Blood Products

#### Recommendations
| Product | Indication |
|---------|------------|
| Red blood cells | Transfuse when Hb <7.0 g/dL |
| Platelets | Transfuse if <10,000/μL (prophylactic) |
| Platelets | If <20,000/μL with bleeding risk |
| Fresh frozen plasma | Only for bleeding or invasive procedures |

### Glucose Control

#### Recommendations
| Target | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Upper limit | <180 mg/dL |
| Hypoglycemia | Avoid |
| Protocol | Validated insulin protocol |

### Renal Replacement Therapy

#### Recommendations
| Aspect | Recommendation |
|--------|----------------|
| Indication | Standard indications (refractory hyperkalemia, acidosis, fluid overload) |
| Modality | CRRT or intermittent based on hemodynamics |
| Timing of initiation | Not routinely early |

### VTE Prophylaxis

#### Recommendations
| Agent | Recommendation |
|-------|----------------|
| LMWH | Preferred over UFH |
| Mechanical | Add to pharmacologic if no contraindication |

### Nutrition

#### Recommendations
| Timing | Recommendation |
|--------|----------------|
| Early enteral | Within 72 hours if feasible |
| Avoid PN | Do not initiate early PN alone |
| Prokinetics | Consider if intolerance |

### Goals of Care

#### Recommendations
| Element | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Discuss within 72 hours | Goals of care conversation |
| Palliative care | Integrate principles |
| Family communication | Regular updates |
