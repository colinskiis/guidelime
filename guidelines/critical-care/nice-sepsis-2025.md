## Scope
Updated evidence-based recommendations for the recognition, assessment, and early management of sepsis in all age groups, including pregnant women.

## Key Recommendations

### Recognition and Risk Stratification
- **Early Suspicion**: Use a systematic approach to identify people with suspected sepsis (e.g., National Early Warning Score [NEWS2] in adults).
- **Red Flags (High Risk)**:
  - Objective evidence of new altered mental state.
  - Systolic BP ≤90 mmHg (or 40 mmHg below normal).
  - Heart rate >130 bpm.
  - Respiratory rate ≥25 breaths/min.
  - Needs oxygen to keep SpO2 >92% (or >88% in COPD).
  - Non-blanching rash, mottled/ashen/cyanotic skin.
  - Lactate ≥2 mmol/L.

### Initial Management (Within 1 Hour)
- **The "Sepsis Six" Principles**:
  1. Give high-flow oxygen (if indicated).
  2. Take blood cultures.
  3. Give IV antibiotics (broad-spectrum, tailored to likely source).
  4. Start IV fluid resuscitation (30 mL/kg crystalloid if hypotensive or lactate ≥4).
  5. Check serial lactates.
  6. Measure urine output.

### Antibiotic Stewardship
- **Empirical Therapy**: Start antibiotics within 1 hour for those with "high risk" criteria.
- **Review**: Senior clinical review within 24 hours to consider narrowing or stopping antibiotics based on culture results and clinical response.

### Specific Populations
- **Pregnancy**: High index of suspicion needed. Use pregnancy-specific physiological triggers.
- **Children**: Use age-appropriate heart rate and respiratory rate thresholds for risk stratification.

### Sepsis and COVID-19/Flu
- Updated guidance on distinguishing sepsis from severe viral respiratory infections and managing co-infections.

### Recovery and Support
- Provide information about sepsis and its long-term effects ("Post-Sepsis Syndrome").
- Ensure a structured follow-up plan is in place after discharge.
