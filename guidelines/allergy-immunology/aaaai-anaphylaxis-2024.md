## Scope
2024 practice parameter update from the Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters (JTFPP), providing the latest evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis and management of anaphylaxis.

## Key Recommendations

### Diagnosis
- **Clinical Diagnosis**: Anaphylaxis is a clinical diagnosis based on the rapid onset of typical signs and symptoms (skin/mucosal, respiratory, cardiovascular, GI) after exposure to a likely allergen.
- **Tryptase**: A peak serum tryptase level >11.4 ng/mL (or >1.2x baseline + 2 ng/mL) supports the diagnosis but is not required. It should be drawn 15 minutes to 3 hours after symptom onset.

### Acute Management
- **Epinephrine is First-Line**: Intramuscular epinephrine (0.3-0.5 mg in adults) into the mid-outer thigh is the first-line and most critical treatment for anaphylaxis. There is no absolute contraindication to epinephrine in anaphylaxis.
- **Positioning**: Patients should lie supine with lower extremities raised (unless respiratory distress or vomiting requires an upright position).
- **Adjunctive Therapies**: IV fluids for hypotension. H1-antihistamines and corticosteroids may help address skin symptoms but do not treat or prevent the core, life-threatening features of anaphylaxis.

### Observation
- **Monitoring Period**: Patients should be observed for at least 4–6 hours after the resolution of symptoms due to the risk of biphasic reactions (up to 20% of cases).
- **Criteria for Discharge**: Symptom resolution, patient education on avoidance, and provision of at least two epinephrine auto-injector prescriptions.

### Long-Term Management
- **Allergy Referral**: All patients should be referred to an allergist for identification of the trigger and management of future risk.
- **Action Plan**: A written anaphylaxis emergency action plan should be provided.
- **Avoidance**: Strict avoidance of identified triggers is key.
- **Venom Immunotherapy**: Should be offered to patients with systemic reactions to stinging insects.
- **Medical Alert**: Recommend wearing medical identification jewelry.
