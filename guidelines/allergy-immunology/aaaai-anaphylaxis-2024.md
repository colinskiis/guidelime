## Scope
2024 update to the Joint Task Force Practice Parameter on the diagnosis and management of anaphylaxis.

## Key Recommendations

### Diagnosis
- Anaphylaxis is a clinical diagnosis based on rapid onset of symptoms involving skin/mucosal tissue AND at least one other organ system (respiratory, cardiovascular, GI).
- Tryptase levels: Elevated serum tryptase (>2 + 1.2x baseline) supports the diagnosis but is not required.

### First-Line Treatment
- **Epinephrine (IM)**: The ONLY first-line treatment. Administer immediately, intramuscularly into the mid-outer thigh (0.01 mg/kg, max 0.5 mg adults, 0.3 mg children).
- **Repeat Dosing**: A second dose may be given after 5-15 minutes if symptoms persist or recur.
- **Positioning**: Place patient supine with lower extremities elevated unless contraindicated.

### Adjunctive Therapies
- **H1-Antihistamines**: May relieve cutaneous symptoms but do NOT treat cardiovascular or respiratory compromise. Should NOT delay epinephrine.
- **Glucocorticoids**: Evidence for preventing biphasic reactions is weak; use is optional.
- **Bronchodilators (Albuterol)**: For bronchospasm refractory to epinephrine.

### Post-Anaphylaxis Management
- **Observation**: Monitor for 4-8 hours or longer depending on severity and risk of biphasic reaction.
- **Epinephrine Auto-Injector (EAI) Prescription**: Prescribe at least 2 EAIs at discharge for all patients experiencing anaphylaxis.
- **Allergy Referral**: Refer for evaluation to identify triggers and for consideration of allergen immunotherapy where applicable.

### Special Populations
- **Infants**: Diagnosis can be challenging; epinephrine is safe and indicated.
- **Mast Cell Disorders**: Patients with mastocytosis or elevated baseline tryptase are at higher risk for severe anaphylaxis.
