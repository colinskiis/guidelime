## Scope
Updated practice parameter for diagnosis and management of anaphylaxis, with emphasis on epinephrine use and recognition of underlying mast cell disorders.

## Key Recommendations

### Diagnosis

#### Updated Clinical Criteria
Anaphylaxis is highly likely when ONE of the following occurs:

1. **Acute onset** (minutes to hours) of skin/mucosal involvement (hives, pruritus, flushing, angioedema) PLUS ONE of:
   - Respiratory compromise (dyspnea, wheeze, stridor, hypoxemia)
   - Hypotension or end-organ dysfunction
   - Severe GI symptoms (cramping, vomiting)

2. **Two or more** of the following rapidly after exposure to likely allergen:
   - Skin/mucosal involvement
   - Respiratory compromise
   - Hypotension or associated symptoms
   - Persistent GI symptoms

3. **Hypotension** after exposure to known allergen for that patient

#### Serum Tryptase
- Obtain baseline AND acute tryptase (ideally 1-4 hours after symptom onset)
- Elevated acute tryptase supports diagnosis
- Persistent elevation suggests underlying mast cell disorder (mastocytosis)
- Consider referral if baseline tryptase elevated

### Treatment

#### First-Line: Epinephrine (IM)
- **ONLY first-line treatment** for anaphylaxis
- Administer immediately upon recognition
- Do NOT delay for observation or other medications

#### Dosing
| Population | Dose |
|------------|------|
| Adults | 0.3-0.5 mg IM (1:1000) |
| Children | 0.01 mg/kg (max 0.3 mg) |
| Infants | 0.01 mg/kg |

**Site**: Lateral thigh (vastus lateralis)

**Repeat**: Every 5-15 minutes if symptoms persist

#### Epinephrine Autoinjectors (EAI)
- Prescribe 2 devices (may need repeat dosing)
- Available doses: 0.1mg, 0.15mg, 0.3mg
- Train patient and caregivers on proper use
- Review indications for use at each visit

### Adjunctive Medications
| Medication | Role |
|------------|------|
| H1-antihistamines | Relieve itching, hives; NOT first-line |
| H2-antihistamines | May provide additional benefit |
| Glucocorticoids | May prevent biphasic reactions; NOT first-line |
| Bronchodilators | For bronchospasm unresponsive to epinephrine |
| IV fluids | For hypotension |

### Post-Anaphylaxis Care

#### Observation Period
- Observe minimum 4-6 hours after symptom resolution
- Extended observation (12-24 hours) if:
  - Severe reaction
  - Required multiple epinephrine doses
  - History of biphasic reactions
  - Delayed access to emergency care

#### Discharge Planning
- Prescribe EAI (minimum of 2)
- Written anaphylaxis action plan
- Referral to allergist for trigger identification
- Medical alert identification recommended
- Education on allergen avoidance

### Special Considerations

#### When to Call 911
- Epinephrine administered
- Symptoms not promptly and completely resolving
- Patient history of severe reactions
- Limited access to emergency care

#### Mastocytosis Workup
Consider if:
- Elevated baseline tryptase
- Recurrent unexplained anaphylaxis
- Hymenoptera venom anaphylaxis with hypotension
- Anaphylaxis to small allergen doses

### Common Triggers
- Foods (peanut, tree nuts, shellfish, milk, egg)
- Medications (antibiotics, NSAIDs)
- Hymenoptera stings (bees, wasps, hornets)
- Latex
- Exercise
- Idiopathic (no identifiable trigger)
