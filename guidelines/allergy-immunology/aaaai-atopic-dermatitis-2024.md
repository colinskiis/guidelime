## Scope
Comprehensive 2024 update to the Joint Task Force Practice Parameter on atopic dermatitis, addressing diagnosis, evaluation, and management from an allergy/immunology perspective.

## Key Recommendations

### Diagnosis
- Clinical diagnosis based on pruritus, typical distribution (flexural in older children/adults, facial/extensor in infants), chronic/relapsing course, and personal/family history of atopy.
- Criteria: Modified Hanifin and Rajka or UK Working Party.

### Evaluation
- **Allergy Testing**: Consider IgE testing (skin prick or serum sIgE) for aeroallergens and foods in patients with moderate-to-severe or refractory AD, particularly if there is suspicion of a specific trigger.
- **Patch Testing**: For suspected allergic contact dermatitis superimposed on AD.
- **Avoid Unnecessary Food Elimination Diets**: Only eliminate foods if there is clear clinical reactivity on reintroduction or positive oral food challenge.

### Skin Barrier Repair
- **Emollients/Moisturizers**: Cornerstone of therapy. Apply liberally and frequently (at least once daily) to maintain barrier function.
- **Bathing Practices**: Lukewarm baths followed by immediate application of moisturizer ("soak and seal").

### Pharmacological Management
- **Topical Corticosteroids**: First-line anti-inflammatory.
- **Topical Calcineurin Inhibitors, PDE4 Inhibitors**: Steroid-sparing alternatives.
- **Systemic Therapies**: Dupilumab (preferred biologic), JAK inhibitors, and traditional immunosuppressants for severe disease.

### Infectious Complications
- **Staphylococcus aureus Colonization**: Common. Consider dilute bleach baths for recurrent infections.
- **Eczema Herpeticum**: Requires prompt antiviral treatment.
