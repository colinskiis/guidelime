## Scope
Comprehensive guideline for the management of patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS), incorporating new evidence since 2013-2014 guidelines.

## Key Recommendations

### Initial Evaluation
- Rapid assessment and risk stratification upon presentation
- 12-lead ECG within 10 minutes of first medical contact
- High-sensitivity troponin testing for diagnosis

### STEMI Management
- Door-to-balloon time goal: <90 minutes for primary PCI
- Primary PCI preferred over fibrinolysis when available within appropriate timeframe
- If PCI not available within 120 minutes, consider fibrinolysis followed by transfer

### NSTE-ACS Management
- Risk stratification using validated scores
- Early invasive strategy for high-risk patients
- Timing of angiography based on risk assessment

### Antiplatelet Therapy
- Aspirin for all ACS patients (indefinitely)
- P2Y12 inhibitor in addition to aspirin (DAPT)
- Duration of DAPT based on bleeding and ischemic risk assessment

### Anticoagulation
- Parenteral anticoagulation during hospitalization
- Selection based on treatment strategy (invasive vs. conservative)

### Reperfusion Strategies
- Primary PCI remains preferred for STEMI
- Complete revascularization may be considered for multivessel disease
- Culprit-only PCI in cardiogenic shock with multivessel disease

### Secondary Prevention
- High-intensity statin therapy
- ACE inhibitor or ARB for reduced LVEF or high-risk patients
- Beta-blocker following MI
- Cardiac rehabilitation referral

### Special Populations
- Considerations for elderly patients
- Chronic kidney disease modifications
- Diabetes management

## Evidence Review
Comprehensive literature search conducted from July 2023 to April 2024, including research from MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and other selected databases.
