## Scope
Focused update addressing changes in HF treatment recommendations based on new RCTs since 2021, including guidance for HFrEF, HFmrEF, HFpEF, and acute HF.

## Key Definitions

| Classification | LVEF |
|----------------|------|
| HFrEF (Reduced) | ≤40% |
| HFmrEF (Mildly Reduced) | 41-49% |
| HFpEF (Preserved) | ≥50% |

## Key Recommendations

### HFrEF (LVEF ≤40%) - "Fantastic Four"
Quadruple therapy recommended for ALL patients with HFrEF:

| Drug Class | Recommendation | Evidence |
|------------|----------------|----------|
| ACEi/ARNI | Class I | Level A |
| Beta-blocker | Class I | Level A |
| MRA | Class I | Level A |
| SGLT2 inhibitor | Class I | Level A |

**Key Update**: Rapid initiation and titration of all four drug classes recommended, especially after HF decompensation (Class I, Level B).

### HFmrEF (LVEF 41-49%)

| Drug Class | Recommendation | Evidence |
|------------|----------------|----------|
| SGLT2 inhibitor | Class I | Level A |
| ACEi/ARB/ARNI | Class IIb | Level C |
| Beta-blocker | Class IIb | Level C |
| MRA | Class IIb | Level C |

**Key Update**: SGLT2 inhibitors now have strongest evidence in HFmrEF.

### HFpEF (LVEF ≥50%)

| Drug Class | Recommendation | Evidence |
|------------|----------------|----------|
| SGLT2 inhibitor | Class I | Level A |
| Diuretics for congestion | Class I | Level C |

**Key Update**: SGLT2 inhibitors are the ONLY Class I, Level A recommendation for HFpEF.

### SGLT2 Inhibitors
- Dapagliflozin and empagliflozin have proven benefit across entire LVEF spectrum
- Recommended regardless of diabetes status
- Reduce HF hospitalization and cardiovascular death

### Acute Heart Failure Updates
- Early initiation of guideline-directed medical therapy before discharge
- Rapid titration strategy supported
- SGLT2 inhibitors can be initiated during hospitalization

### Iron Deficiency
- Screen for iron deficiency in all HF patients
- IV iron (ferric carboxymaltose or ferric derisomaltose) recommended for symptomatic HFrEF/HFmrEF with iron deficiency

### Device Therapy
- ICD for primary prevention in HFrEF (LVEF ≤35%) despite ≥3 months optimal medical therapy
- CRT for HFrEF with LBBB and QRS ≥150ms

## Important Notes
- This 2023 update supplements, not replaces, the 2021 full guidelines
- SGLT2 inhibitors represent major paradigm shift in HF treatment
- Emphasis on early, comprehensive therapy initiation
