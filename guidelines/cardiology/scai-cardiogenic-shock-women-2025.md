## Scope
First multi-society expert consensus statement focusing specifically on sex-specific considerations in the diagnosis and management of cardiogenic shock (CS) in women.

## Key Recommendations

### Sex Differences in Epidemiology
- Women are underrepresented in CS clinical trials.
- Women presenting with AMI-related CS tend to be older, have more comorbidities, and may have higher in-hospital mortality.

### Unique Etiologies in Women
- **Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection (SCAD)**: A leading cause of AMI in young women, especially peripartum. Treatment differs from atherosclerotic MI; conservative management is often preferred.
- **Takotsubo Syndrome (Stress Cardiomyopathy)**: More common in postmenopausal women. May present with CS. Supportive care is mainstay; avoid inotropes if LVOT obstruction present.
- **Peripartum Cardiomyopathy (PPCM)**: A potentially reversible cause of CS in late pregnancy or postpartum. Consider bromocriptine as adjunctive therapy.

### Mechanical Circulatory Support (MCS)
- MCS devices are often undersized for women. Device selection should account for smaller vessel and body size.
- Vascular complications from MCS are more frequent in women.

### Management Considerations
- **Antiplatelet/Anticoagulation Dosing**: Women are at higher bleeding risk; consider weight-based dosing and avoid overdosing.
- **Multidisciplinary Shock Team**: Recommended to coordinate care, especially for complex or pregnancy-related CS.

### Pregnancy-Related CS
- Emergent delivery may be life-saving.
- LV support with devices like Impella is feasible and has been used successfully in pregnancy/peripartum SCAD and PPCM.
