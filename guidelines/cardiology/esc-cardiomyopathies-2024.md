## Scope
2024 ESC guidelines on the diagnosis, risk stratification, and management of cardiomyopathies including hypertrophic (HCM), dilated (DCM), arrhythmogenic (ACM), and restrictive cardiomyopathies.

## Key Recommendations

### General Approach
- **Systematic Phenotyping**: Comprehensive evaluation including ECG, echocardiography, CMR, and family history.
- **Genetic Testing**: Recommended for index cases and cascade screening of first-degree relatives.
- **Multidisciplinary Care**: Involve cardiologists, geneticists, electrophysiologists, and cardiac surgeons.

### Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM)

#### Diagnosis
- LV wall thickness ≥15 mm (or ≥13 mm with family history/genetic confirmation) not explained by loading conditions.

#### SCD Risk Stratification
- Use the HCM Risk-SCD calculator; consider ICD for 5-year risk ≥6%.
- Additional risk modifiers: massive LVH, LV apical aneurysm, extensive LGE on CMR.

#### Treatment
- **Beta-Blockers, Non-DHP CCBs**: First-line for symptoms.
- **Mavacamten**: Cardiac myosin inhibitor. Approved for symptomatic obstructive HCM (LVOT gradient ≥50 mmHg). Reduces obstruction and symptoms.
- **Septal Reduction Therapy**: Surgical myectomy (preferred at experienced centers) or alcohol septal ablation for refractory symptoms.
- **ICD**: For high SCD risk.

### Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM)
- Standard HF therapy (GDMT): ACEi/ARNI, beta-blocker, MRA, SGLT2i.
- ICD for primary prevention if LVEF ≤35% despite ≥3 months GDMT.
- CRT if LBBB with QRS ≥130 ms.

### Arrhythmogenic Cardiomyopathy (ACM)
- Exercise restriction (avoid competitive/endurance sports).
- ICD for high-risk features (sustained VT, syncope, significant RV/LV dysfunction).
- Antiarrhythmics (sotalol, amiodarone) or ablation for recurrent VT.
