## Scope
2024 ESC guideline update on the diagnosis and management of aortic stenosis (AS).

## Key Recommendations

### Diagnosis and Assessment
- **Echocardiography**: First-line for AS diagnosis and grading.
  - Severe AS: Aortic valve area (AVA) <1.0 cm², mean gradient ≥40 mmHg, peak velocity ≥4.0 m/s.
- **CT Aortic Valve Calcium Score**: Useful in low-flow, low-gradient AS to confirm severity.
- **Stress Testing**: Consider in asymptomatic patients to unmask symptoms or exercise limitations.

### Indications for Intervention

#### Symptomatic Severe AS
- **Class I Indication**: Intervention is recommended for all patients with symptomatic severe AS (dyspnea, angina, syncope).

#### Asymptomatic Severe AS
- Consider intervention if:
  - Very severe AS (Vmax >5 m/s, mean gradient >60 mmHg).
  - LVEF <55%.
  - Positive exercise test (symptoms, hypotension).
  - BNP >3x normal without other explanation.
  - Severe valve calcification + rapid progression.
  - If undergoing other cardiac surgery.

### Choice of Intervention (Heart Team Decision)

#### Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement (SAVR)
- Preferred for younger patients (typically <70-75 years), low surgical risk, bicuspid AS, combined procedures (CABG, aortic root surgery).

#### Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR)
- Preferred for older patients (typically ≥75-80 years), high/intermediate surgical risk.
- Expanding indications to lower-risk patients in appropriate anatomy.
- Lifetime valve durability considerations favor SAVR in younger patients.

### Medical Therapy
- No medical therapy proven to delay AS progression.
- Optimize comorbidities (hypertension, CAD, HF).
- Avoid excessive afterload reduction in severe AS if symptomatic.

### Follow-Up
- Regular clinical and echocardiographic surveillance based on severity and symptoms.
