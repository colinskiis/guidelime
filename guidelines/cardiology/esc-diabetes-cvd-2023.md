## Scope
Evidence-based recommendations for prevention and management of cardiovascular disease in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.

## Key Recommendations

### Cardiovascular Risk Assessment

#### Risk Categories
| Category | Definition |
|----------|------------|
| Very high risk | DM + established ASCVD OR severe target organ damage |
| High risk | DM ≥10 years without TOD + any other risk factor |
| Moderate risk | Young patients (T1DM <35y, T2DM <50y) with DM <10 years, no other risk factors |

### SGLT2 Inhibitors and GLP-1 Receptor Agonists

#### Proven CV Benefit Agents
**SGLT2 Inhibitors:**
- Empagliflozin
- Canagliflozin
- Dapagliflozin
- Sotagliflozin

**GLP-1 Receptor Agonists:**
- Liraglutide
- Semaglutide (subcutaneous)
- Dulaglutide
- Efpeglenatide

### Treatment Recommendations by Condition

#### Diabetes + ASCVD
| Recommendation | Class |
|----------------|-------|
| SGLT2 inhibitor and/or GLP-1 RA recommended to reduce CV risk | I |
| Independent of glucose control | I |
| In addition to standard of care (antiplatelet, BP, lipid therapy) | I |

#### Diabetes + Heart Failure

##### HFrEF (LVEF ≤40%)
- SGLT2 inhibitors (dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, sotagliflozin) **Class I**
- Reduce HF hospitalization and CV death
- Independent of glycemic control

##### HFmrEF (LVEF 41-49%) and HFpEF (LVEF ≥50%)
- SGLT2 inhibitors **Class I**
- Reduce HF hospitalization and CV death
- Independent of glycemic control

#### Diabetes + CKD (eGFR ≥20 mL/min/1.73m²)
- SGLT2 inhibitor **Class I** to reduce CVD and kidney failure
- Continue until dialysis or transplant

### Glycemic Targets
- **HbA1c target**: Generally <7% (individualized)
- Avoid hypoglycemia, especially in CV disease
- Avoid agents with high hypoglycemia risk (sulfonylureas, insulin) when alternatives available

### Blood Pressure Management
- **Target**: <130/80 mmHg (if tolerated)
- ACEi or ARB first-line, especially with albuminuria
- Combination therapy often needed

### Lipid Management
- **LDL-C targets**:
  - Very high risk: <55 mg/dL (1.4 mmol/L) AND ≥50% reduction
  - High risk: <70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L) AND ≥50% reduction
  - Moderate risk: <100 mg/dL (2.6 mmol/L)
- High-intensity statin for most patients with diabetes
- Add ezetimibe, then PCSK9 inhibitor if target not met

### Antiplatelet Therapy
- **Primary prevention**: Not routinely recommended (individualized)
- **Secondary prevention**: Aspirin (or clopidogrel if intolerant)
- Consider dual antiplatelet therapy per ACS/PCI guidelines

### Lifestyle Recommendations
- Weight loss if overweight/obese (target ≥5-10%)
- Mediterranean diet
- Physical activity: ≥150 min/week moderate intensity
- Smoking cessation

## Key Messages
- SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 RAs reduce CV events independent of glucose lowering
- These agents should be prioritized in patients with established CVD or high risk
- Comprehensive CV risk management essential (BP, lipids, lifestyle)
- Individualize therapy based on comorbidities and patient preferences
