## Scope
2024 ACC expert consensus decision pathway for lipid management in patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) for secondary prevention.

## Key Recommendations

### LDL-C Targets
- **Very High-Risk ASCVD**: LDL-C goal <55 mg/dL.
- **High-Risk ASCVD (without additional risk enhancers)**: LDL-C goal <70 mg/dL.

### Statin Therapy (Cornerstone)
- Start high-intensity statin (atorvastatin 40-80 mg or rosuvastatin 20-40 mg) as first-line therapy.
- If statin intolerant, try alternative statin, lower dose, or every-other-day dosing.

### Add-On Therapies (If LDL-C Not at Goal)
1. **Ezetimibe (10 mg daily)**: Lowers LDL-C by ~18-20%. Add if LDL-C not at goal on maximally tolerated statin.
2. **PCSK9 Inhibitors (Evolocumab, Alirocumab)**: Subcutaneous injection. Lowers LDL-C by ~50-60%. Indicated if LDL-C remains elevated despite statin + ezetimibe.
3. **Inclisiran**: siRNA therapy targeting PCSK9. Twice-yearly dosing. For patients on maximally tolerated statin ± ezetimibe who require additional LDL-C lowering.
4. **Bempedoic Acid**: ACL inhibitor. Oral. Useful for statin-intolerant patients or as add-on therapy.

### Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)]
- Consider measuring Lp(a) once in all ASCVD patients. Elevated Lp(a) (>50 mg/dL or >125 nmol/L) identifies higher residual risk.
- No approved Lp(a)-lowering therapies yet, but trials ongoing.

### Lifestyle
- Heart-healthy diet, physical activity, weight management, smoking cessation remain foundational.
