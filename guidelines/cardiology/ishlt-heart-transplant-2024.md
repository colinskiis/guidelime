## Scope
Comprehensive 2024 update to the ISHLT guidelines for the evaluation and care of cardiac transplant candidates, superseding the 2006 and 2016 versions.

## Key Recommendations

### Indications for Heart Transplantation
- **Stage D Heart Failure**: Heart transplantation is recommended for patients with advanced (Stage D) heart failure who have exhausted all other medical and surgical options and have an acceptable risk profile.
- **Peak VO2**: A peak oxygen consumption (VO2) <12-14 mL/kg/min on cardiopulmonary exercise testing is a key indicator for listing.

### Candidate Selection
- **Age**: Advanced age alone is not a contraindication, but a comprehensive assessment of frailty and comorbidities is essential.
- **Renal/Hepatic Function**: Irreversible, severe renal or hepatic dysfunction is a relative contraindication. Combined heart-kidney or heart-liver transplantation may be considered.
- **Psychosocial Assessment**: A thorough psychosocial evaluation, including substance abuse history (particularly ongoing tobacco or drug use), is mandatory.
- **Malignancy**: A defined cancer-free interval (typically 5 years, depending on cancer type) is required.

### Sensitization
- **Panel Reactive Antibodies (PRA)**: High PRA is associated with increased risk of antibody-mediated rejection. Desensitization strategies may be employed for highly sensitized patients.

### Bridge to Transplant with MCS
- **LVAD**: Durable left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are an established bridge-to-transplant strategy for eligible patients, improving functional status while awaiting a donor heart.

### Post-Transplant Management (Key elements)
- **Immunosuppression**: Standard induction and maintenance immunosuppression regimens are reviewed, including the use of anti-thymocyte globulin or basiliximab for induction.
- **Surveillance for Rejection**: Routine endomyocardial biopsies and/or gene expression profiling are used to monitor for rejection.
