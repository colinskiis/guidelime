## Scope

This guideline provides comprehensive recommendations for the diagnosis, classification, and management of pulmonary hypertension (PH) in adults.

## Key Recommendations

### Classification
- Group 1: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)
- Group 2: PH due to left heart disease
- Group 3: PH due to lung disease/hypoxia
- Group 4: Chronic thromboembolic PH (CTEPH)
- Group 5: Multifactorial mechanisms

### Diagnostic Workup
- Echocardiography for screening
- Right heart catheterization (RHC) confirmatory
- mPAP ≥20 mmHg defines PH (lowered from 25)
- PVR >2 WU for pre-capillary PH
- V/Q scan to exclude CTEPH

### Risk Stratification (PAH)
- Low risk: 1-year mortality <5%
- Intermediate-low/high: 5-20%
- High risk: >20%
- Variables: Functional class, 6MWD, BNP, hemodynamics

### PAH Treatment
**General Measures:**
- Exercise rehabilitation
- Supervised exercise training
- Diuretics for fluid management
- Oxygen if hypoxemic

**PAH-Specific Therapy:**
- Combination therapy from diagnosis recommended
- PDE5 inhibitors (sildenafil, tadalafil)
- Endothelin receptor antagonists (ambrisentan, macitentan, bosentan)
- Prostacyclin pathway (selexipag, epoprostenol, treprostinil)
- sGC stimulator (riociguat)
- Sotatercept for inadequate response (new)

### CTEPH
- Pulmonary endarterectomy for operable disease
- Balloon pulmonary angioplasty for inoperable
- Riociguat for residual/inoperable disease

### Referral
- Early referral to expert PH center
- Transplant evaluation for high-risk/deteriorating patients
