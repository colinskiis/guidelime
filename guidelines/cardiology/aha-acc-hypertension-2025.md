## Scope
Major 2025 update to the US hypertension guideline, the first comprehensive revision since 2017, addressing thresholds, targets, and management across the lifespan.

## Key Recommendations

### Classification
- **Elevated BP**: SBP 120-129 and DBP <80 mmHg.
- **Stage 1 Hypertension**: SBP 130-139 or DBP 80-89 mmHg.
- **Stage 2 Hypertension**: SBP ≥140 or DBP ≥90 mmHg.

### Treatment Thresholds
- **General Adults**: Lifestyle modification at BP ≥120/80. Pharmacotherapy recommended at SBP ≥130/80 for those with clinical ASCVD or 10-year ASCVD risk ≥10%.
- **Primary Prevention (Low Risk)**: Pharmacotherapy may be considered at ≥140/90 mmHg.

### Treatment Targets
- **General Target**: Goal is SBP <130 mmHg and DBP <80 mmHg for most adults who tolerate therapy.
- **Older Adults (≥65)**: Target <130 mmHg if tolerated, with careful attention to orthostatic hypotension, polypharmacy, and falls.

### Lifestyle Modification (Cornerstone of Therapy)
- **DASH Diet**: A diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy.
- **Sodium Restriction**: Target <1500 mg/day (or at least a reduction of 1000 mg/day).
- **Physical Activity**: 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity per week.
- **Weight Management**: Target BMI <25 kg/m².
- **Alcohol Moderation**: ≤1 drink/day for women, ≤2 drinks/day for men.

### Pharmacotherapy
- **First-line Agents**: Thiazide diuretics (especially chlorthalidone), ACEi/ARBs, and dihydropyridine CCBs.
- **Initial Combination Therapy**: Recommended for most patients, especially if BP is ≥20/10 mmHg above target.
- **Single-Pill Combinations (SPCs)**: Preferential use of SPCs to improve adherence.

### Resistant Hypertension
- Definition: BP above goal despite using ≥3 antihypertensives (including a diuretic) at optimal doses.
- **Add-on Therapy**: Spironolactone (or eplerenone) is the recommended fourth agent.

### Out-of-Office BP Measurement
- Strongly recommends use of Home BP Monitoring (HBPM) or Ambulatory BP Monitoring (ABPM) for diagnosis confirmation and management guidance.
