# ESC Guidelines for the Management of Cardiomyopathies

## Scope
Comprehensive guidelines covering diagnosis and management of all cardiomyopathy phenotypes, including hypertrophic, dilated, arrhythmogenic, restrictive, and non-dilated left ventricular cardiomyopathies.

## Key Recommendations

### Classification

#### Cardiomyopathy Phenotypes
| Phenotype | Key Features |
|-----------|--------------|
| Hypertrophic (HCM) | LV wall thickness ≥15 mm without loading condition |
| Dilated (DCM) | LV dilation and systolic dysfunction |
| Arrhythmogenic (ACM) | RV/LV dysfunction with arrhythmias |
| Restrictive (RCM) | Restrictive filling, normal/near-normal volumes |
| Non-dilated LV (NDLVC) | LV dysfunction without dilation |

### Initial Evaluation

#### Required Testing
| Test | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| ECG | Rhythm, conduction, hypertrophy |
| Echocardiography | Structure and function |
| CMR | Tissue characterization, fibrosis |
| Genetic testing | Etiology, family screening |
| Family screening | Identify at-risk relatives |

#### Laboratory
- BNP/NT-proBNP
- Troponin
- Kidney function
- Liver function
- Ferritin and iron studies

### Genetic Testing

#### Indications (Strong)
- All patients with cardiomyopathy
- First-degree relatives of gene-positive individuals
- Cascade screening in families

#### Key Genes by Phenotype
| Phenotype | Common Genes |
|-----------|--------------|
| HCM | MYH7, MYBPC3 |
| DCM | TTN, LMNA, MYH7 |
| ACM | PKP2, DSP, DSG2 |

### Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy

#### Medical Management
- Beta-blockers first-line for symptoms
- Verapamil or diltiazem if beta-blocker contraindicated
- Disopyramide for refractory symptoms

#### Mavacamten
- Cardiac myosin inhibitor
- For symptomatic obstructive HCM
- Alternative to septal reduction therapy

#### Septal Reduction Therapy
| Indication | Options |
|------------|---------|
| Refractory symptoms with LVOT gradient ≥50 mmHg | Surgical myectomy (preferred) or alcohol septal ablation |

#### ICD for SCD Prevention
- Consider based on risk assessment (HCM Risk-SCD calculator)
- Family history of SCD
- Unexplained syncope
- Massive LVH (≥30 mm)
- NSVT
- Abnormal BP response to exercise

### Dilated Cardiomyopathy

#### Medical Therapy (GDMT)
- ACE inhibitor/ARB/ARNI
- Beta-blocker
- MRA
- SGLT2 inhibitor
- Diuretics for congestion

#### Device Therapy
- ICD for primary prevention if LVEF ≤35% despite GDMT
- CRT if LBBB and LVEF ≤35%

#### Specific Etiologies
| Etiology | Additional Management |
|----------|----------------------|
| LMNA mutation | Earlier ICD consideration |
| Tachycardia-induced | Rate control, ablation |
| Peripartum | Standard HF therapy; caution with bromocriptine |

### Arrhythmogenic Cardiomyopathy

#### Diagnosis
- Task Force Criteria (structural, histological, ECG, arrhythmic, genetic)
- CMR essential

#### Management
- Avoid competitive sports
- Beta-blockers
- ICD for high-risk patients
- Antiarrhythmic drugs (amiodarone, sotalol)
- Catheter ablation for refractory VT

### Restrictive Cardiomyopathy

#### Etiologies
- Amyloidosis (AL, ATTR)
- Sarcoidosis
- Storage diseases
- Endomyocardial fibrosis

#### Cardiac Amyloidosis
| Type | Treatment |
|------|-----------|
| AL amyloidosis | Chemotherapy targeting plasma cells |
| ATTR amyloidosis | Tafamidis, patisiran, inotersen |

### Family Screening

#### Protocol
- Clinical evaluation of first-degree relatives
- ECG and echocardiography
- Genetic testing if variant identified
- Repeat screening periodically in genotype-negative relatives

### Exercise Recommendations
- Individualized based on phenotype and risk
- Generally avoid competitive sports in high-risk patients
- Moderate exercise may be safe in some low-risk patients
- Discuss with specialized center

### Pregnancy
- Risk stratification before conception
- High-risk: severe LV dysfunction, severe obstruction, arrhythmias
- Multidisciplinary management
- Continue beta-blockers (most are safe)
