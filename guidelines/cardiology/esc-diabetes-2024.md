## Scope

This guideline provides recommendations for cardiovascular risk assessment and management in patients with diabetes mellitus.

## Key Recommendations

### Risk Classification
- Very high risk: ASCVD, target organ damage, or multiple risk factors
- High risk: Diabetes duration ≥10 years or another risk factor
- Moderate risk: Young patients with controlled diabetes, no risk factors

### Glycemic Targets
- HbA1c <7% for most patients
- Individualized targets based on age, comorbidities, hypoglycemia risk
- Avoid hypoglycemia, especially in elderly and CVD patients

### Cardiovascular Protective Medications
**SGLT2 Inhibitors (Class I):**
- All T2DM with ASCVD or high CV risk
- All T2DM with heart failure (regardless of EF)
- CKD with albuminuria

**GLP-1 Receptor Agonists (Class I):**
- T2DM with ASCVD or high CV risk
- Weight reduction benefit
- May combine with SGLT2i

### Lipid Management
- LDL-C target <55 mg/dL for very high risk
- LDL-C target <70 mg/dL for high risk
- High-intensity statin therapy
- Add ezetimibe or PCSK9i if target not achieved

### Blood Pressure
- Target <130/80 mmHg
- ACEi or ARB first-line
- Avoid dual RAAS blockade

### Antiplatelet Therapy
- Aspirin for secondary prevention
- Primary prevention: Consider if high CVD risk without high bleeding risk

### Heart Failure Management
- SGLT2i in all HF regardless of diabetes status
- Standard HF medications per HF guidelines
- Optimize glucose control with CV-safe agents

### Screening
- Coronary artery disease screening in symptomatic patients
- CAC score may aid risk stratification in asymptomatic
