## Scope
Comprehensive 2024 update to the ESC guidelines for the diagnosis, risk stratification, and management of chronic coronary syndromes (CCS) in adults.

## Key Recommendations

### Diagnosis
- **Pre-test Probability (PTP)**: Use clinical assessment to determine PTP of obstructive CAD before ordering testing.
- **Preferred Initial Test**: Coronary CT Angiography (CCTA) is elevated to a Class I recommendation as a first-line diagnostic test in many patient subsets, particularly those with low-to-intermediate PTP.
- **Functional Testing**: Stress imaging (echo, MRI, nuclear) remains appropriate for patients with intermediate PTP who are not suitable for CCTA or have an inconclusive CT.

### Risk Stratification
- **CCTA**: Can also be used to identify high-risk anatomy (e.g., left main disease, 3-vessel disease).
- **Coronary Artery Calcium (CAC) Score**: CAC=0 is useful for ruling out significant CAD in selected low-risk patients.

### Anti-anginal Therapy
- **First-line**: Beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers.
- **Second-line**: Long-acting nitrates, ranolazine, trimetazidine, or ivabradine may be added for symptom control.

### Revascularization
- **Indications**: Revascularization (PCI or CABG) is primarily indicated for symptom relief if refractory to optimal medical therapy, or for prognostic benefit in patients with high-risk anatomy (e.g., left main, extensive multi-vessel disease).
- **FFR/iFR**: Recommends functional assessment (FFR/iFR) to guide PCI decisions in intermediate stenoses.

### Secondary Prevention
- **Antiplatelets**: Low-dose aspirin remains a cornerstone. Dual antiplatelet therapy may be considered for selected high-risk patients post-ACS.
- **Lipids**: High-intensity statin therapy is mandatory. Target LDL-C <55 mg/dL for very high-risk patients; <70 mg/dL for high-risk.
- **RAAS Inhibitors**: ACE inhibitors or ARBs are recommended for patients with hypertension, diabetes, LV dysfunction, or CKD.
- **SGLT2 Inhibitors**: Recommended for patients with comorbid T2D or HF.

### Lifestyle
- Emphasizes smoking cessation, Mediterranean diet, regular physical activity, and management of psychosocial stress.
