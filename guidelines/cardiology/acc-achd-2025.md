## Scope
Comprehensive 2025 update to the ACC/AHA guideline for the care of adults with congenital heart disease (ACHD), replacing the 2018 version.

## Key Recommendations

### Care Model
- **ACHD-Specialized Centers**: Adults with moderate or complex CHD should receive care at, or in collaboration with, an ACHD accredited center.
- **Transition from Pediatric Care**: Structured transition programs from pediatric to adult cardiology are recommended, ideally starting at age 12-14.

### Surveillance
- **Imaging**: Regular surveillance echocardiography and cardiac MRI (CMR) are recommended. CMR is particularly valuable for assessing RV size/function.
- **Arrhythmia Monitoring**: Holter or event monitoring for patients with palpitations or lesions predisposing to arrhythmia.

### Management of Specific Lesions
The guideline provides lesion-specific recommendations for:
- Atrial Septal Defect (ASD)
- Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD)
- Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF)
- Transposition of the Great Arteries (TGA) post-arterial switch or atrial switch
- Fontan palliation
- Coarctation of the Aorta
- Ebstein Anomaly
- Eisenmenger Syndrome

### Pregnancy
- **Preconception Counseling**: Essential for all women with CHD. Assess maternal and fetal risk based on lesion complexity and functional status.
- **High-Risk Lesions**: Severe pulmonary hypertension (Eisenmenger), severe aortic stenosis, severe systemic ventricular dysfunction, and Marfan syndrome with aortic dilation are high-risk or contraindicated conditions for pregnancy.

### Arrhythmia and Device Therapy
- Atrial arrhythmias are common, especially after atrial level surgery. Catheter ablation may be considered.
- ICD implantation should follow general guideline indications, but decisions require ACHD expertise.

### Endocarditis Prophylaxis
- Prophylaxis is recommended for high-risk lesions (e.g., prosthetic valves, unrepaired cyanotic CHD, prior endocarditis).
