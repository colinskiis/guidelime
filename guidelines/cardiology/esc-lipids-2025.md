## Scope
Focused update addressing new clinical trial evidence since 2019, particularly concerning nuovi pharmacological agents (bempedoic acid, icosapent ethyl, evinacumab, volanesorsen) and the role of Lipoprotein(a).

## Key Recommendations

### Risk Estimation and Modifiers
- **SCORE2 and SCORE2-OP**: Endorsed for 10-year CV risk estimation in primary prevention.
- **Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)]**: Should be measured at least once in each adult's lifetime. A level **>50 mg/dL** (approx. 105 nmol/L) is considered a risk-enhancing factor.
- **Subclinical Atherosclerosis**: Coronary Artery Calcium (CAC) score should be considered as a risk modifier in individuals at moderate risk.

### New Pharmacotherapy
- **Bempedoic Acid**: Recommended for primary and secondary prevention in patients who are statin-intolerant or as an adjunct to maximally tolerated statins if LDL-C targets are not met.
- **Icosapent Ethyl**: Should be considered (4g/day) in high-risk patients with triglycerides between 135–499 mg/dL despite statin therapy.
- **Evinacumab**: May be considered for patients ≥5 years old with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH).
- **Volanesorsen**: Should be considered for patients with familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS) and TG >750 mg/dL.

### Management in Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS)
- **Early Intensification**: Stronger emphasis on hitting LDL-C targets quickly.
- **Combination Therapy**: In patients already on statins, add ezetimibe or a PCSK9 inhibitor during the hospitalization if targets are not met. For statin-naive patients, consider starting high-intensity statin + ezetimibe combo immediately.

### Specific Populations
- **HIV**: Statin therapy is recommended for primary prevention in all people with HIV aged ≥40 years, regardless of traditional risk scores.
- **Cancer**: Statins should be considered in adults at high risk of cardiotoxicity from anthracycline-based chemotherapy.

### LDL-C Targets (Reaffirmed)
- **Very High Risk**: <1.4 mmol/L (55 mg/dL) AND ≥50% reduction from baseline.
- **High Risk**: <1.8 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) AND ≥50% reduction from baseline.
- **Moderate Risk**: <2.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL).
- **Low Risk**: <3.0 mmol/L (116 mg/dL).
