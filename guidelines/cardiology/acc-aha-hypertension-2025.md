# 2025 AHA/ACC Guideline for the Management of High Blood Pressure in Adults

## Scope

Comprehensive updated recommendations for the prevention, detection, evaluation, and management of high blood pressure in adults, reflecting evidence since 2015.

## Key Recommendations

### Blood Pressure Classification
- **Normal**: <120/80 mm Hg
- **Elevated**: 120-129 / <80 mm Hg
- **Stage 1 Hypertension**: 130-139 / 80-89 mm Hg
- **Stage 2 Hypertension**: ≥140/90 mm Hg

### Treatment Goals
- Overarching goal for all adults: **<130/80 mm Hg**.

### Management Strategy
- **Lifestyle Modifications**: Initial therapy for all adults.
- **Medication Initiation**:
  - Recommended for BP ≥140/90 mm Hg.
  - Recommended for BP ≥130/80 mm Hg if: clinical CVD, diabetes, CKD, or 10-year CV risk ≥7.5% (by PREVENT™ calculator).
- **Stage 2 Management**: Preferred initiation with two first-line agents in a single-pill fixed-dose combination (SPC/FDC).

### Risk Assessment
- Uses the **PREVENT™** risk calculator instead of the older ASCVD risk estimator.

## Notes

Major updates include the adoption of the PREVENT risk assessment tool, a universal target of <130/80, and a stronger emphasis on single-pill combinations for Stage 2 hypertension.
