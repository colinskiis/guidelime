## Scope

Management of the entire spectrum of acute coronary syndromes including STEMI, NSTEMI, and unstable angina - from initial presentation through acute management, reperfusion, and secondary prevention.

## Notes

First time ESC combined STEMI and NSTE-ACS into a single unified ACS guideline. Previously these were covered in separate documents.
