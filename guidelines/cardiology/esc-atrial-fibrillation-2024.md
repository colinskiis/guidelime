## Scope
Comprehensive 2024 update to the ESC guidelines for the diagnosis, classification, and management of atrial fibrillation (AF) in adults.

## Key Recommendations

### Classification and Diagnosis
- **AF Classification**: Introduces a new streamlined clinical classification: First diagnosed, Paroxysmal, Persistent, Long-standing persistent, and Permanent.
- **Screening**: Recommends opportunistic screening for AF in adults aged ≥65, particularly in those with known risk factors like hypertension, diabetes, or HF.

### Stroke Prevention (Anticoagulation)
- **CHA2DS2-VASc**: Oral anticoagulation (OAC) is recommended for men with CHA2DS2-VASc ≥2 and women with CHA2DS2-VASc ≥3.
- **NOACs/DOACs**: Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are preferred over warfarin for stroke prevention.
- **LAA Occlusion**: Left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) may be considered for patients with clear contraindications to long-term OAC.

### Rhythm vs. Rate Control
- **Early Rhythm Control**: Strong emphasis on considering early rhythm control (within 1 year of diagnosis), particularly in patients with risk factors for progression, as it may improve outcomes.
- **Catheter Ablation**: AF ablation is now a Class I recommendation as first-line therapy for symptomatic AF in selected patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).

### Rate Control
- **Target**: A lenient rate control target (<110 bpm at rest) is generally recommended if symptoms are controlled.
- **Agents**: Beta-blockers and non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (diltiazem, verapamil) are first-line for rate control.

### Integrated Management (AF-CARE)
- Introduces the **AF-CARE** pathway framework: **C**omorbidity and risk factor management, **A**nticoagulation/stroke prevention, **R**ate and rhythm control, **E**valuation and dynamic reassessment.

### Lifestyle and Comorbidity Management
- **Weight Management**: Strong recommendation for weight reduction in patients who are overweight or obese.
- **Alcohol**: Recommends limiting alcohol consumption to <3 standard drinks per week.
- **OSA**: Screening for and managing obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is recommended for patients with AF.
