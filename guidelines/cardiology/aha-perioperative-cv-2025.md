## Scope

This guideline provides recommendations for cardiovascular evaluation and management of patients undergoing noncardiac surgery.

## Key Recommendations

### Risk Assessment
**Stepwise Approach:**
1. Urgency of surgery (emergency vs. elective)
2. Active cardiac conditions (ACS, decompensated HF, severe valvular disease, significant arrhythmias)
3. Surgical risk (low, intermediate, elevated)
4. Functional capacity (≥4 METs adequate)
5. Clinical risk factors (RCRI)

### Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI)
- History of ischemic heart disease
- History of heart failure
- History of cerebrovascular disease
- Diabetes requiring insulin
- Creatinine >2 mg/dL
- High-risk surgery

### Preoperative Testing
**ECG:**
- Consider for patients with known CAD, significant arrhythmia, or undergoing elevated-risk procedures

**Stress Testing:**
- Not routine
- Consider if poor functional capacity AND elevated-risk surgery AND results would change management

**Echocardiography:**
- If unexplained dyspnea
- Known HF with clinical change
- Known severe valvular disease needing assessment

### Coronary Revascularization
- Not recommended solely to reduce perioperative cardiac risk
- Follow standard indications for revascularization

### Medication Management
**Continue:**
- Beta-blockers (do not start de novo immediately preoperatively)
- Statins (beneficial perioperatively)

**Hold:**
- ACEi/ARB on day of surgery (consider holding)
- DAPT: Balance stent thrombosis vs. bleeding risk

### Special Populations
- Recent coronary stent: Delay elective surgery (minimum 30 days for BMS, 3-6 months for DES)
- Heart failure: Optimize preoperatively
- Severe aortic stenosis: Consider intervention before elective high-risk surgery

### Post-operative Monitoring
- Troponin for high-risk patients with symptoms or ECG changes
- Early ambulation and VTE prophylaxis
