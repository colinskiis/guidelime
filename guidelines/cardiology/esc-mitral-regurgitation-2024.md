## Scope
2024 ESC guideline update on the management of primary and secondary mitral regurgitation.

## Key Recommendations

### Classification
- **Primary (Organic) MR**: Intrinsic valve pathology (myxomatous degeneration, rheumatic, endocarditis).
- **Secondary (Functional) MR**: LV dysfunction/dilation causing malcoaptation; valve is structurally normal.

### Assessment
- **Echocardiography (TTE/TEE)**: Quantify MR severity (ERO, regurgitant volume), assess etiology, LV function, LA size, pulmonary pressures.
- **CMR**: Useful for MR quantification and LV assessment.

### Indications for Surgery – Primary MR

#### Symptomatic Severe Primary MR
- Surgery (repair preferred over replacement) is recommended.

#### Asymptomatic Severe Primary MR
- Surgery recommended if:
  - LVEF ≤60% or LVESD ≥40 mm.
  - New-onset AF or PASP >50 mmHg.
  - Flail leaflet with LVESD ≥40 mm.
  - High likelihood of durable repair.

### Mitral Valve Repair vs. Replacement
- **Repair**: Preferred when feasible (degenerative disease, experienced center). Lower operative mortality, better long-term outcomes.
- **Replacement**: When repair is not feasible or unlikely to be durable.

### Secondary MR
- Optimize GDMT for heart failure first.
- **Transcatheter Edge-to-Edge Repair (TEER, e.g., MitraClip)**: Consider in symptomatic severe secondary MR despite optimal medical therapy, with favorable anatomy and not a candidate for surgery. Evidence of benefit in HFrEF with significant MR (COAPT criteria).
- Surgical correction of secondary MR is considered when undergoing CABG/other cardiac surgery.

### Heart Team
- Complex MR decisions should involve a multidisciplinary heart team.
