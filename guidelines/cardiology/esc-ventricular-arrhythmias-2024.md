## Scope
2024 ESC guideline on the management of ventricular arrhythmias (VA) and prevention of sudden cardiac death (SCD).

## Key Recommendations

### Evaluation
- **12-Lead ECG**: Assess for structural heart disease, long QT, Brugada, ARVC.
- **Echocardiography**: LV function, structural abnormalities.
- **CMR**: For ARVC, scar evaluation, cardiomyopathies.
- **Electrophysiology Study (EPS)**: May guide management in selected cases.
- **Genetic Testing**: For suspected inherited arrhythmia syndromes.

### Primary Prevention of SCD

#### Ischemic Cardiomyopathy
- **ICD**: Recommended for LVEF ≤35% despite ≥3 months of GDMT, NYHA II-III, life expectancy >1 year.
- Revascularization and GDMT should be optimized first.

#### Non-Ischemic Cardiomyopathy
- **ICD**: For LVEF ≤35%, NYHA II-III, despite optimal medical therapy. Risk stratification (LGE on CMR, genetics) may refine selection.

#### Inherited Arrhythmia Syndromes (Long QT, Brugada, CPVT, ARVC)
- Beta-blockers (LQTS, CPVT).
- ICD for high-risk features (prior arrest, syncope, high-risk genotypes).
- Avoid triggers (QT-prolonging drugs, exercise in CPVT).

### Secondary Prevention
- **ICD**: For survivors of VF arrest or sustained VT without reversible cause.

### Antiarrhythmic Drug Therapy
- **Amiodarone**: Most effective for VT suppression; significant side effects.
- **Sotalol**: Alternative.
- **Mexiletine**: Adjunct for recurrent VT.
- Beta-blockers reduce ICD shocks.

### Catheter Ablation
- Indicated for recurrent VT despite antiarrhythmics, VT storm, or as first-line in selected patients (e.g., idiopathic VT).

### Wearable Cardioverter-Defibrillator (WCD)
- Consider as bridge in patients at transient high SCD risk (post-MI awaiting ICD, peripartum cardiomyopathy).
