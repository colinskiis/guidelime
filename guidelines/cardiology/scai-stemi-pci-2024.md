## Scope
2024 SCAI expert consensus statement providing practical guidance for interventionalists managing patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

## Key Recommendations

### System Goals
- **First Medical Contact-to-Device Time**: Goal is <90 minutes for patients presenting directly to a PCI-capable hospital.
- **Door-In-Door-Out Time (Transfer)**: For patients transferred from non-PCI centers, goal is <30 minutes.
- **Cath Lab Activation**: Pre-hospital ECG transmission and cath lab activation are encouraged.

### Vascular Access
- **Radial Access Preferred**: Transradial access is the default approach due to reduced bleeding and mortality compared to femoral access.
- **Femoral Access**: May be appropriate for hemodynamically unstable patients requiring MCS or those with failed radial access.

### Procedural Considerations
- **Culprit Lesion PCI**: Focus on PCI of the infarct-related artery (IRA) only during the index procedure for hemodynamically stable patients.
- **Complete Revascularization**: Consider staged or in-hospital complete revascularization of non-culprit lesions in stable patients with multivessel disease.
- **Thrombus Aspiration**: Routine thrombus aspiration is not recommended; may be considered selectively for high thrombus burden.
- **Drug-Eluting Stents (DES)**: Preferred over bare-metal stents.

### Antithrombotic Therapy
- **Antiplatelet Loading**: Aspirin + a P2Y12 inhibitor (prasugrel or ticagrelor preferred over clopidogrel).
- **Antithrombin Therapy**: Unfractionated heparin (UFH) or bivalirudin.
- **Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa Inhibitors**: May be considered for large thrombus burden or slow/no-reflow.

### Cardiogenic Shock
- **Mechanical Circulatory Support (MCS)**: Early initiation of MCS (e.g., Impella, IABP) should be considered for patients with cardiogenic shock refractory to initial management.
- **Shock Team Approach**: Multidisciplinary shock team involvement is recommended.
