## Scope

This guideline provides comprehensive recommendations for the diagnosis, risk stratification, and management of patients with cardiomyopathies, including hypertrophic, dilated, arrhythmogenic, restrictive, and takotsubo cardiomyopathy.

## Key Recommendations

### General Principles
- Genetic testing and counseling for all cardiomyopathy patients
- Family screening: First-degree relatives should be evaluated
- Phenotype-genotype correlation guides management
- Multidisciplinary care at specialist centers

### Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM)
- SCD risk stratification: HCM Risk-SCD calculator
- ICD for high-risk patients (5-year risk >6%)
- Septal reduction therapy for refractory symptoms with LVOT obstruction
- Mavacamten for symptomatic obstructive HCM
- Exercise: Individualized recommendations based on phenotype

### Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM)
- GDMT for all patients with reduced LVEF
- LMNA mutations: Lower threshold for ICD implantation
- CRT for appropriate candidates per heart failure guidelines
- Genetic testing: Important for prognosis and family screening

### Arrhythmogenic Cardiomyopathy (ACM)
- Updated diagnostic criteria (2020 Padua criteria)
- Exercise restriction: Competitive sports contraindicated
- ICD for secondary prevention; primary prevention based on risk factors
- Catheter ablation for recurrent VT despite medication

### Restrictive Cardiomyopathy (RCM)
- Identify underlying etiology (amyloidosis, storage diseases)
- Cardiac amyloidosis: Tafamidis for ATTR-CM
- Diuretics for congestion; avoid beta-blockers in RCM

### Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (TTS)
- Supportive care; identify and address triggers
- Beta-blockers controversial for long-term prevention
- Monitor for recovery (typically weeks to months)
