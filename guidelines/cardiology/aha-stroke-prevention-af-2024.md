## Scope
2024 AHA/ACC/HRS focused update on stroke prevention strategies in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF).

## Key Recommendations

### Stroke Risk Assessment
- **CHA2DS2-VASc Score**: Assess stroke risk.
  - Men ≥2 or Women ≥3: Anticoagulation recommended.
  - Men 1 or Women 2: Anticoagulation may be considered.
  - Men 0 or Women 1: Anticoagulation generally not recommended.
- Risk assessment applies to paroxysmal, persistent, and permanent AF equally.

### Anticoagulation Therapy

#### Direct Oral Anticoagulants (DOACs) – Preferred
- **Apixaban, Rivaroxaban, Edoxaban, Dabigatran**: Recommended over warfarin for most patients with AF (non-valvular).
- Equal or superior efficacy to warfarin with lower bleeding risk (especially intracranial hemorrhage).

#### Warfarin
- Reserved for patients with mechanical heart valves, moderate-to-severe mitral stenosis, or contraindication to DOACs.
- Target INR 2-3.

### Bleeding Risk
- Assess bleeding risk (HAS-BLED) but do NOT withhold anticoagulation solely due to high bleeding risk if stroke risk is elevated. Optimize modifiable bleeding risk factors.

### Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion (LAAO)
- **Watchman, Amulet Devices**: Consider for patients with AF and contraindication to long-term anticoagulation.
- Not a substitute for anticoagulation in patients who can tolerate it.

### Antiplatelet Therapy
- Aspirin or dual antiplatelet therapy is NOT recommended as an alternative to anticoagulation for stroke prevention in AF.

### Rate and Rhythm Control
- Addressed in AF management guidelines; stroke prevention remains critical regardless of rate vs. rhythm control strategy.
