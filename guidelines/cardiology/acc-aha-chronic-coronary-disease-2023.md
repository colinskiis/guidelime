## Scope

Comprehensive management of patients with established chronic coronary disease including lifestyle modification, pharmacotherapy for secondary prevention, and revascularization strategies.

## Notes

Replaces terminology "stable ischemic heart disease" with "chronic coronary disease" to better reflect the dynamic nature of the condition. Emphasizes shared decision-making and patient-centered care.
