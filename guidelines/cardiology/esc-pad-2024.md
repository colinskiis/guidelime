## Scope
Comprehensive 2024 update for the diagnosis and management of diseases of the peripheral arteries and aorta, including lower extremity artery disease (LEAD), carotid artery disease, and aortic aneurysms/dissections.

## Key Recommendations

### Diagnosis (Lower Extremity Artery Disease - LEAD)
- **Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI)**: ABI <0.90 is diagnostic for LEAD. Toe-brachial index (TBI) should be used if vessels are non-compressible (e.g., diabetes).
- **Duplex Ultrasound**: Recommended as the first-line imaging modality for localization and severity assessment.
- **CTA/MRA**: Recommended when revascularization is being considered.

### Medical Therapy
- **Antiplatelets**: Long-term single antiplatelet therapy (aspirin or clopidogrel) is recommended for all symptomatic LEAD patients.
- **Rivaroxaban**: Low-dose rivaroxaban (2.5 mg BID) plus aspirin (100 mg) is recommended for patients with LEAD without high bleeding risk to reduce major cardiovascular events (COMPASS trial).
- **Statins**: High-intensity statin therapy is mandatory. Target LDL-C <55 mg/dL.

### Management of Claudication
- **Supervised Exercise Therapy (SET)**: Recommended as the first-line treatment for intermittent claudication.
- **Pharmacotherapy**: Cilostazol may be considered for symptom relief if SET alone is insufficient.
- **Revascularization**: For lifestyle-limiting symptoms despite SET, revascularization (endovascular preferred when feasible) is indicated.

### Management of Chronic Limb-Threatening Ischemia (CLTI)
- **Urgent Revascularization**: Required to prevent limb loss.
- **Multidisciplinary Team**: Management should be coordinated with vascular surgery, interventional radiology, and wound care specialists.

### Aortic Aneurysm
- **Surveillance**: The threshold for elective repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) remains ≥5.5 cm in most men and ≥5.0 cm in women or patients with certain high-risk features.
- **EVAR vs. Open Repair**: Both endovascular (EVAR) and open surgical repair are acceptable; patient anatomy and frailty guide the choice.

### Aortic Dissection
- **Type A**: Emergency surgical intervention is required.
- **Type B**: Initial medical management with antihypertensive therapy (beta-blockers) is standard for uncomplicated dissection.
