## Scope
2024 AHA scientific statement on the use of lipid-lowering therapy for primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD).

## Key Recommendations

### Risk Assessment
- Use the Pooled Cohort Equations (PCE) or PREVENT calculator to estimate 10-year ASCVD risk.
- **Risk-Enhancing Factors**: Family history of premature ASCVD, elevated Lp(a), chronic kidney disease, metabolic syndrome, inflammatory conditions, South Asian ancestry, etc.

### When to Consider Statin Therapy (Primary Prevention)

#### LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL
- High-intensity statin regardless of risk calculation.

#### Diabetes (Age 40-75)
- At least moderate-intensity statin. High-intensity if multiple risk factors.

#### Estimated 10-Year ASCVD Risk ≥7.5% (Age 40-75)
- Moderate-to-high intensity statin therapy is recommended.
- For borderline risk (5-7.5%), shared decision-making using risk-enhancing factors.

### LDL-C Targets (Primary Prevention)
- No specific LDL-C target mandated in primary prevention, but aim for ≥50% reduction with high-intensity statin when indicated.

### Coronary Artery Calcium (CAC) Scoring
- If risk decision is uncertain, CAC scoring may help. CAC = 0 favors deferring statins; CAC ≥100 or ≥75th percentile favors initiation.

### Lifestyle Intervention
- Heart-healthy diet, physical activity, weight management, smoking cessation are foundational for all patients regardless of statin use.

### Non-Statin Therapies
- In primary prevention, non-statin therapies (ezetimibe, PCSK9i) are generally not first-line but may be considered in select high-risk patients (e.g., familial hypercholesterolemia).
