## Scope
2024 ACC/AHA expert consensus pathway on the evaluation and management of syncope in adults.

## Key Recommendations

### Initial Evaluation
- **History**: Detailed prodrome, triggers, position, activity, witnesses' account, post-event state.
- **Physical Exam**: Orthostatic vital signs, cardiovascular exam, neurological exam.
- **12-Lead ECG**: Required in all patients. Look for arrhythmia, long QT, Brugada, WPW, HCM, or ischemia.

### Risk Stratification
- **High-Risk Features (Consider Cardiac Cause)**: Syncope during exertion, palpitations preceding syncope, no prodrome, syncope while supine, family history of SCD, structural heart disease, abnormal ECG.
- **Low-Risk Features (Reflex/Vasovagal)**: Prolonged prodrome (warmth, nausea, diaphoresis), triggered by standing/emotion/pain, young age, no heart disease.

### Diagnostic Testing (Guided by Pre-Test Probability)
- **Echocardiography**: If structural heart disease suspected.
- **Holter/Event Monitor**: Inpatient telemetry or outpatient monitoring if arrhythmia suspected.
- **Implantable Loop Recorder (ILR)**: For recurrent unexplained syncope after initial workup.
- **Tilt-Table Test**: For suspected vasovagal syncope with diagnostic uncertainty.
- **Electrophysiology Study**: Selected patients with structural heart disease.
- **Neuroimaging, EEG**: Generally NOT recommended unless seizure is suspected.

### Management

#### Vasovagal Syncope
- **Lifestyle Measures**: Hydration, salt intake, physical counter-pressure maneuvers, tilt training.
- **Midodrine, Fludrocortisone**: May be considered for refractory cases.
- **Pacemaker**: Only for recurrent, cardioinhibitory vasovagal syncope with asystole documented.

#### Cardiac Syncope
- Treat underlying condition: ICD for ventricular arrhythmia, pacemaker for sinus node dysfunction/AV block, revascularization for ischemia.

### Driving Restrictions
- Vary by etiology and local regulations. Generally, temporary restriction after unexplained syncope.
