## Scope

This expert consensus document provides guidance on the management of patients with cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs), including pacemakers, ICDs, and cardiac resynchronization therapy devices.

## Key Recommendations

### Device Selection
**Pacemakers:**
- Single-chamber (VVI/AAI) for specific indications
- Dual-chamber (DDD) if AV synchrony needed
- Leadless pacemakers for selected patients

**ICDs:**
- Secondary prevention after VT/VF arrest
- Primary prevention per HF/LVEF criteria
- Subcutaneous ICD if no pacing indication

**CRT:**
- HFrEF (LVEF ≤35%) + LBBB ≥150ms
- Consider for LVEF ≤35%, LBBB 130-149ms
- CRT-D vs CRT-P based on ICD indications

### Perioperative Management
- Device interrogation before surgery
- Magnet availability
- Deactivate ICD therapy intraoperatively if electrocautery used
- Program to asynchronous pacing if pacemaker-dependent
- Re-interrogate post-procedure

### MRI Considerations
- Most contemporary devices MRI-conditional
- Follow manufacturer programming protocols
- Monitor during scan
- Re-interrogate after MRI

### Lead Management
- Lead extraction for infection (class I)
- Consider extraction for lead malfunction, upgrade, venous occlusion
- Specialized center preferred

### Device Infection
- Complete system extraction
- Prolonged antibiotics
- Reimplantation after infection cleared (contralateral site)

### End-of-Life Considerations
- Discuss device deactivation as part of goals of care
- ICD therapy deactivation common in terminal illness
- Pacemaker deactivation less common; ethical considerations
- Document patient preferences clearly

### Remote Monitoring
- Recommended for all CIED patients
- Allows early detection of issues
- Reduces in-person visits
