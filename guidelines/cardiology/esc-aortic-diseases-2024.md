## Scope

This guideline provides comprehensive recommendations for the diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of thoracic and abdominal aortic diseases.

## Key Recommendations

### Screening
- AAA screening: Men ≥65 years (one-time ultrasound)
- Family screening: First-degree relatives of patients with thoracic aortic disease
- Genetic testing for heritable aortopathies (Marfan, Loeys-Dietz, vascular EDS)

### Imaging
- CT angiography for acute aortic syndromes
- MRA or CTA for surveillance
- Echocardiography for aortic root assessment
- Indexed aortic dimensions for decision-making

### Medical Therapy
- BP control (target <130/80, lower in Marfan)
- Beta-blockers for aortic dilation
- ARBs (losartan) in Marfan syndrome
- Statin therapy for atherosclerotic disease

### Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm - Intervention Thresholds
- Ascending aorta ≥55mm (general population)
- ≥50mm with risk factors (family history, rapid growth >5mm/year)
- ≥45mm in Marfan, bicuspid aortic valve with risk factors
- ≥42mm in Loeys-Dietz, TGFBR mutations

### Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm
- Repair threshold ≥55mm (men), ≥50mm (women)
- Earlier if rapid growth (>10mm/year) or symptomatic
- EVAR vs. open repair based on anatomy and patient factors

### Acute Aortic Syndromes
- Type A dissection: Emergency surgical repair
- Type B uncomplicated: Medical management, BP/HR control
- Type B complicated: TEVAR or surgery
- Intramural hematoma: Management per dissection type

### Surveillance
- Annual imaging for stable aneurysms
- More frequent if approaching intervention threshold
- Lifelong follow-up post-repair
