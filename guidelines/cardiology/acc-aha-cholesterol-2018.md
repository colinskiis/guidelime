## Scope
Evidence-based recommendations for management of blood cholesterol to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk in adults.

## Key Recommendations

### Statin Therapy Indications

#### Primary Prevention
| Group | LDL-C Threshold | Recommendation |
|-------|-----------------|----------------|
| LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL | Any | High-intensity statin (Class I) |
| Diabetes, age 40-75 | Any | Moderate-intensity statin (Class I) |
| Diabetes + multiple risk factors | Any | High-intensity statin (Class IIa) |
| Estimated 10-year ASCVD risk ≥7.5% | ≥70 mg/dL | Moderate-to-high intensity statin (Class I) |
| Estimated 10-year ASCVD risk 5-<7.5% | - | Consider moderate-intensity statin (Class IIb) |

#### Secondary Prevention (Clinical ASCVD)
- **High-intensity statin** to reduce LDL-C by ≥50% (Class I)
- If LDL-C remains ≥70 mg/dL on maximally tolerated statin, add ezetimibe (Class IIa)
- If very high risk with LDL-C ≥70 mg/dL on statin + ezetimibe, add PCSK9 inhibitor (Class IIa)

### Statin Intensity Categories

| Intensity | LDL-C Reduction | Examples |
|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| High | ≥50% | Atorvastatin 40-80mg, Rosuvastatin 20-40mg |
| Moderate | 30-49% | Atorvastatin 10-20mg, Rosuvastatin 5-10mg, Simvastatin 20-40mg |
| Low | <30% | Simvastatin 10mg, Pravastatin 10-20mg |

### Very High-Risk ASCVD
Criteria (any of):
- History of multiple major ASCVD events
- One major ASCVD event + multiple high-risk conditions

Consider adding nonstatin therapy if LDL-C ≥70 mg/dL on maximally tolerated statin.

### Coronary Artery Calcium (CAC) Score
For intermediate-risk patients (10-year ASCVD risk 5-<20%):
- **CAC = 0**: May defer statin (except smokers, diabetics, strong family history)
- **CAC 1-99**: Favors statin, especially if ≥55 years
- **CAC ≥100 or ≥75th percentile**: Statin therapy indicated

### Nonstatin Therapies

#### Ezetimibe
- Lowers LDL-C ~15-20% additional
- Add if on maximally tolerated statin with LDL-C above goal

#### PCSK9 Inhibitors
- Evolocumab, alirocumab
- Lower LDL-C ~50-60% additional
- For very high-risk ASCVD or familial hypercholesterolemia

#### Bempedoic Acid
- Alternative for statin-intolerant patients
- Lowers LDL-C ~15-25%

### Monitoring
- Repeat lipid panel 4-12 weeks after statin initiation or dose change
- Then every 3-12 months as needed
- Assess adherence and lifestyle modifications

### Lifestyle Modifications
- Heart-healthy diet (reduce saturated fat, increase fiber)
- Regular physical activity
- Weight management
- Smoking cessation
