## Scope

This guideline provides comprehensive recommendations for the diagnosis, risk stratification, and management of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

## Key Recommendations

### Diagnosis
- Echocardiography: LV wall thickness ≥15mm (or ≥13mm with family history/genetic confirmation)
- CMR for confirmation and tissue characterization
- Genetic testing recommended for probands
- Family screening for first-degree relatives

### Sudden Cardiac Death Risk Stratification
**HCM Risk-SCD Calculator:**
- Age, maximal LV wall thickness, LA size, LVOT gradient, family history SCD, NSVT, unexplained syncope
- 5-year SCD risk categories guide ICD decision

**ICD Recommendations:**
- Primary prevention: 5-year risk ≥6% (Class IIa)
- Consider if 5-year risk 4-6% with additional risk features (apical aneurysm, extensive LGE)
- Secondary prevention after VT/VF arrest (Class I)

### Symptom Management
**Obstructive HCM:**
- Beta-blockers (first-line for symptoms)
- Non-dihydropyridine CCBs (verapamil, diltiazem) if beta-blocker intolerant
- Disopyramide add-on for refractory symptoms
- Mavacamten (cardiac myosin inhibitor) for symptomatic obstructive HCM
- Septal reduction therapy (myectomy or alcohol ablation) if refractory

**Non-Obstructive HCM:**
- Beta-blockers or CCBs for symptoms
- Diuretics cautiously for congestion
- HF therapy if systolic dysfunction develops

### Lifestyle and Exercise
- Individualized exercise recommendations
- Avoid competitive high-intensity sports (traditional recommendation)
- Shared decision-making for recreational sports

### Atrial Fibrillation
- High risk of stroke; anticoagulate regardless of CHA2DS2-VASc
- Rate or rhythm control per symptoms
