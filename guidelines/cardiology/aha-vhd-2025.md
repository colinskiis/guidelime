## Scope

This guideline provides comprehensive recommendations for the evaluation and management of adults with valvular heart disease (VHD), including native valve disease, prosthetic valve management, and infective endocarditis.

## Key Recommendations

### Aortic Stenosis (AS)
- Symptomatic severe AS: Aortic valve intervention recommended (Class I)
- Asymptomatic severe AS with LVEF <50%: Intervention recommended
- TAVR vs SAVR: Age and surgical risk stratification updated
- Low-flow, low-gradient AS: Dobutamine stress echo for evaluation

### Aortic Regurgitation (AR)
- Symptomatic severe AR: Surgery recommended (Class I)
- Asymptomatic severe AR with LVEF ≤55% or LVESD >50mm: Surgery recommended
- Serial imaging for monitoring disease progression

### Mitral Regurgitation (MR)
- Primary MR: Mitral repair preferred over replacement when feasible
- Secondary MR: Medical therapy optimization first-line
- Transcatheter edge-to-edge repair: Expanded indications for secondary MR

### Mitral Stenosis (MS)
- Symptomatic severe MS with favorable anatomy: PMBV recommended
- Unfavorable anatomy or concomitant MR: Surgical intervention

### Tricuspid Valve Disease
- Severe TR at time of left-sided valve surgery: Concomitant tricuspid repair
- Isolated severe symptomatic TR: Surgical or transcatheter intervention considered

### Prosthetic Valve Management
- Anticoagulation for mechanical valves: INR targets specified
- Bioprosthetic valve surveillance: Echocardiographic monitoring schedule
- Valve thrombosis: Anticoagulation vs intervention decision pathway

### Infective Endocarditis
- Antibiotic prophylaxis: High-risk patients and procedures
- Early surgery indications: Heart failure, uncontrolled infection, embolic prevention
