## Scope
2024 AHA scientific statement on the role of cardiac rehabilitation (CR) in secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease.

## Key Recommendations

### Indications for Cardiac Rehabilitation (Strongly Recommended)
- Acute myocardial infarction (STEMI/NSTEMI).
- Post-PCI or CABG.
- Stable angina/CAD.
- Heart failure (HFrEF and HFpEF).
- Post-valve repair/replacement.
- Post-heart transplant.
- Peripheral artery disease.

### Core Components of CR
1. **Exercise Training**: Supervised aerobic and resistance exercise. Personalized prescription based on baseline functional capacity.
2. **Risk Factor Modification**: BP, lipid, and glucose management.
3. **Psychosocial Support**: Stress management, depression/anxiety screening and intervention.
4. **Nutritional Counseling**: Heart-healthy diet education.
5. **Smoking Cessation**: Intensive support and pharmacotherapy.
6. **Medication Adherence**: Education and titration of GDMT.

### Benefits
- Reduces cardiovascular mortality and hospital readmissions.
- Improves functional capacity, quality of life, and symptom burden.
- Cost-effective intervention.

### Referral and Enrollment
- Automatic referral at hospital discharge is most effective ("opt-out" strategy).
- Barriers to enrollment (transportation, time, socioeconomic) should be addressed.
- Home-based or hybrid CR programs may improve access.

### Exercise Prescription
- Initial: Low-moderate intensity (40-60% of peak HR or VO2).
- Progress to moderate-vigorous intensity over weeks.
- Duration: 30-60 minutes per session, 3-5 times/week.
- Typical program: 36 sessions over 12 weeks.

### Underutilization
- CR is vastly underutilized (<25% of eligible patients enroll).
- Efforts to improve referral, reduce disparities (women, minorities, elderly), and expand access are critical.
