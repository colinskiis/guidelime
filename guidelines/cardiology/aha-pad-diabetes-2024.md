## Scope
2024 AHA scientific statement on the unique considerations for diagnosing and managing peripheral artery disease (PAD) in adults with diabetes mellitus.

## Key Recommendations

### Screening and Diagnosis
- Screen for PAD in all adults with diabetes ≥50 years old, or younger if high-risk features (smoking, hypertension, dyslipidemia, long-duration diabetes, DKD, etc.).
- **Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI)**: First-line test. ABI ≤0.90 indicates PAD. ABI >1.40 suggests medial arterial calcification (common in diabetes); use toe-brachial index (TBI) or other modalities.
- Assess for claudication symptoms, but many diabetic patients are asymptomatic due to neuropathy.

### Medical Therapy
- **Antiplatelet Therapy**: Single antiplatelet (aspirin or clopidogrel) is recommended for symptomatic PAD.
- **Statin Therapy**: High-intensity statin for all patients with PAD.
- **Antihypertensive Therapy**: ACEi/ARB preferred for renal and CV protection.
- **Glycemic Control**: Optimize using agents with CV benefit (SGLT2i, GLP-1 RA) when possible.
- **Smoking Cessation**: Critical for slowing disease progression.

### Claudication Management
- Supervised exercise therapy is first-line for improving walking distance.
- Cilostazol (PDE3 inhibitor) may provide symptomatic improvement.

### Chronic Limb-Threatening Ischemia (CLTI)
- High risk of amputation; requires urgent multidisciplinary care (vascular surgery, endovascular, wound care, podiatry).
- Revascularization (endovascular or surgical bypass) is indicated when feasible.

### Wound and Foot Care
- Emphasize prevention: foot exams, proper footwear, early treatment of wounds.
- Multidisciplinary diabetic foot teams for ulcer management.
