## Scope

Comprehensive management of valvular heart disease including aortic, mitral, tricuspid, and pulmonic valve disorders. Covers evaluation, medical therapy, timing of intervention, and choice of surgical vs transcatheter approaches.

## Notes

Replaces 2014 guideline and 2017 focused update. Major updates include expanded indications for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and updated recommendations for management of secondary mitral regurgitation.
