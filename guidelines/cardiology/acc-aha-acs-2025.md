## Scope
Comprehensive evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis, initial management, and long-term secondary prevention for patients presenting with suspected or confirmed acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

## Key Recommendations

### Diagnosis and Risk Stratification
- **High-Sensitivity Troponin (hs-cTn)**: Recommended as the primary biomarker for the rapid diagnosis and exclusion of myocardial infarction (MI). Recommends using validated 0/1-hour or 0/2-hour algorithms.
- **Risk Scores**: Use of validated risk scores (e.g., GRACE or HEART) to guide the timing of invasive strategies in NSTE-ACS.

### Initial Pharmacological Management
- **Aspirin**: Immediate administration of non-enteric-coated aspirin (162-325 mg) is recommended for all patients with suspected ACS.
- **P2Y12 Inhibitors**: Recommended for use in combination with aspirin (DAPT). Prasugrel or ticagrelor are preferred over clopidogrel for patients undergoing PCI.
- **Anticoagulation**: Recommended for all patients during the acute phase. Choice depends on the management strategy (e.g., UFH, bivalirudin, or enoxaparin).

### Revascularization Strategies
- **STEMI**: Primary PCI remains the gold standard for reperfusion if it can be performed within 90-120 minutes of first medical contact.
- **NSTE-ACS**: An early invasive strategy (within 24 hours) is recommended for high-risk patients. A conservative strategy may be appropriate for low-risk patients.

### Dual Antiplatelet Therapy (DAPT) Duration
- **Standard Duration**: 12 months of DAPT after PCI for ACS is the default.
- **Shortened Duration**: For patients at high bleeding risk (HBR), a shorter duration of DAPT (e.g., 1-3 months) followed by P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy can be considered.
- **Extended Duration**: For patients at high ischemic risk and low bleeding risk, extended DAPT beyond 12 months may be beneficial.

### Secondary Prevention
- **Statins**: High-intensity statin therapy (e.g., atorvastatin 80 mg or rosuvastatin 20-40 mg) should be initiated in all patients.
- **Beta-blockers**: Recommended for patients with reduced EF (≤40%) or prior MI.
- **ACE Inhibitors/ARBs**: Recommended for patients with HF, reduced EF, diabetes, or CKD.
- **SGLT2 Inhibitors**: Recommended for patients with ACS and comorbid HF or T2D.

### Systems of Care
- **ACS Networks**: Emphasizes the importance of coordinated regional systems of care to ensure timely access to PCI and optimal transition to cardiac rehabilitation.
