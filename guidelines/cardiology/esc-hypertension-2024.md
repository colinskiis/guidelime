## Scope
Comprehensive 2024 update to the ESC guidelines for the diagnosis, assessment, and management of elevated blood pressure and hypertension in adults.

## Key Recommendations

### Classification and Measurement
- **Classification**: Hypertension: Office SBP ≥140 and/or DBP ≥90 mmHg.
- **ABPM/HBPM**: Out-of-office blood pressure measurement (24h ABPM or HBPM) is recommended for confirmation of diagnosis, detection of white-coat/masked hypertension, and monitoring of treatment.

### Treatment Thresholds and Targets
- **General Threshold**: Start pharmacotherapy if office BP ≥140/90 mmHg despite lifestyle modifications.
- **High-Risk Patients**: Consider starting at lower threshold (e.g., ≥130/80) for patients with established CVD.
- **General Target**: Aim for on-treatment SBP of 120-129 mmHg and DBP <80 mmHg for most patients, providing it is well tolerated.
- **Older Adults (≥80)**: Target SBP <140 mmHg, but a more lenient target (140-150 mmHg) may be acceptable depending on frailty.

### First-Line Treatment
- **Initial Combination Therapy**: The standard of care is initial combination therapy for most patients, ideally a single-pill combination (SPC).
- **Preferred Combinations**: RAS blocker (ACEi or ARB) + Calcium Channel Blocker (CCB) OR RAS blocker + Thiazide/Thiazide-like diuretic.

### Drug Classes
- **ACEi/ARBs**: A cornerstone, particularly for patients with diabetes, CKD, or HF.
- **CCBs (e.g., Amlodipine)**: First-line, especially in older adults or Black patients.
- **Thiazide-like Diuretics (e.g., Chlorthalidone, Indapamide)**: Preferred over HCTZ due to better evidence for outcomes.

### Resistant Hypertension
- Definition: BP that remains above target despite three or more antihypertensives (including a diuretic) at optimal or maximally tolerated doses.
- **Add-on Therapy**: Spironolactone (or eplerenone if not tolerated) is the recommended add-on for resistant hypertension.

### Lifestyle Modification
- Dietary Sodium Restriction (<5g salt/day).
- DASH Diet.
- Weight Reduction.
- Regular Aerobic Exercise.
- Moderation of Alcohol.
- Smoking Cessation.
