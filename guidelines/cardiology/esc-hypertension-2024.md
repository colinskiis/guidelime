## Scope

Management of elevated blood pressure and hypertension including new BP classification system, treatment targets, pharmacotherapy, and management of hypertension in special populations.

## Notes

Major change: introduces new BP classification - non-elevated (<120/70), elevated (120-139/70-89), and hypertension (≥140/90). New systolic BP treatment target range of 120-129 mmHg for most treated patients. Title changed from "arterial hypertension" to "elevated blood pressure and hypertension."
