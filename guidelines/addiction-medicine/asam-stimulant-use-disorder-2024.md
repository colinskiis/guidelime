## Scope
First comprehensive clinical practice guideline from ASAM/AAAP addressing the diagnosis, treatment, and long-term management of adults with stimulant use disorders (StUD).

## Key Recommendations

### Psychosocial Treatments (First-line)
- **Contingency Management (CM)**: Strong recommendation as the most effective treatment for StUD. Recommends the use of voucher-based or prize-based CM to promote abstinence.
- **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)**: Recommended as an adjunct or alternative to CM to help patients develop coping skills and prevent relapse.
- **Community Reinforcement Approach (CRA)**: Recommended as an effective intensive behavioral intervention.

### Pharmacological Management
- **General**: No medications currently have FDA approval for StUD.
- **Cocaine Use Disorder**: 
  - Consider **topiramate** or **disulfiram** as potential off-label options in motivated patients.
- **Methamphetamine Use Disorder**: 
  - Strong recommendation for the combination of **injectable naltrexone + high-dose oral bupropion** for patients with moderate-to-severe methamphetamine use disorder.
- **Mirtazapine**: May be considered as an off-label option, especially for those with co-occurring depressive symptoms.

### Management of Intoxication and Withdrawal
- **Intoxication**: Focus on supportive care and environmental calming. Use benzodiazepines for severe agitation or autonomic instability.
- **Withdrawal**: Monitor for "crash" symptoms (fatigue, depression, dysphoria). No specific medications are recommended for the withdrawal phase itself, but psychological support is critical.

### Harm Reduction
- **Engagement**: Utilize harm reduction strategies (e.g., needle exchange, fentanyl test strips) to engage patients even if they are not yet ready for abstinence.
- **Overdose Prevention**: Educate patients on the risks of stimulants being contaminated with fentanyl.

### Co-occurring Disorders
- **ADHD**: If a patient with StUD has confirmed ADHD, treat the ADHD with non-stimulant medications (e.g., atomoxetine) first; stimulants for ADHD should only be used with extreme caution and intensive monitoring in this population.
- **Depression/Anxiety**: Treat comorbid psychiatric conditions alongside the StUD.
