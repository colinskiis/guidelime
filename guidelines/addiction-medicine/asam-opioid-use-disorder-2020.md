## Scope
Evidence-based recommendations for the treatment of opioid use disorder (OUD) using FDA-approved medications, including methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone.

## Key Recommendations

### Assessment and Diagnosis

#### Diagnostic Criteria
- Use DSM-5 criteria for opioid use disorder
- Assess severity (mild, moderate, severe)
- Document medical, psychiatric, and substance use history

#### Comprehensive Assessment
| Component | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Medical history | Including pain, infectious diseases, hepatic/renal function |
| Psychiatric evaluation | Co-occurring mental health disorders |
| Substance use history | All substances, route, frequency, duration |
| Social assessment | Housing, employment, legal, family |
| Physical examination | Signs of intoxication, withdrawal, complications |
| Laboratory testing | Urine drug screen, hepatic panel, HIV/HCV |

### Treatment Options

#### FDA-Approved Medications
| Medication | Mechanism | Setting |
|------------|-----------|---------|
| Methadone | Full opioid agonist | OTP (Opioid Treatment Program) |
| Buprenorphine | Partial opioid agonist | OTP or office-based |
| Naltrexone | Opioid antagonist | Any licensed setting |

#### Medication Selection
| Factor | Considerations |
|--------|----------------|
| Patient preference | Central to shared decision-making |
| Access | Geographic, financial barriers |
| Prior treatment | Response, adherence history |
| Comorbidities | Pain, psychiatric, hepatic conditions |
| Pregnancy | Buprenorphine or methadone |

### Methadone

#### Initiation
| Aspect | Recommendation |
|--------|----------------|
| Starting dose | 10-30 mg/day |
| Maximum first-day dose | Usually ≤40 mg |
| Dose increases | 5-10 mg every 5-7 days |
| Target dose | 60-120 mg/day for most patients |

#### Monitoring
- Daily witnessed dosing initially
- Take-home doses earned with stability
- Regular urine drug screens
- ECG monitoring for QTc prolongation

### Buprenorphine

#### Formulations
| Formulation | Notes |
|-------------|-------|
| Sublingual film/tablet | Most common |
| Buprenorphine/naloxone | Preferred to deter misuse |
| Buprenorphine monoproduct | Pregnancy, injection form |
| Extended-release injection | Monthly subdermal |
| Subdermal implant | 6-month option |

#### Initiation
| Method | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Standard induction | After moderate withdrawal (COWS ≥8-12) |
| Starting dose | 2-4 mg, observe, additional dosing as needed |
| Day 1 maximum | Usually 8-16 mg |
| Maintenance | 8-24 mg/day typical |

#### Micro-Dosing Induction
- Gradual dose escalation over days
- May reduce precipitated withdrawal
- Evidence emerging

### Naltrexone

#### Extended-Release Injectable
| Aspect | Recommendation |
|--------|----------------|
| Dose | 380 mg IM monthly |
| Pre-treatment | Opioid-free 7-10 days minimum |
| Verification | Naloxone challenge or confirmed abstinence |

#### Considerations
- No opioid agonist effects
- Overdose risk if treatment discontinued
- Patient education critical
- Useful for highly motivated patients

### Opioid Withdrawal Management

#### Settings
| Severity | Appropriate Setting |
|----------|---------------------|
| Mild-moderate | Outpatient |
| Severe/complicated | Inpatient/residential |
| Pregnant | Specialized obstetric care |

#### Medications for Withdrawal
| Agent | Use |
|-------|-----|
| Buprenorphine | Preferred; can transition to maintenance |
| Methadone | OTP setting; can transition to maintenance |
| Clonidine | Adjunct for autonomic symptoms |
| Lofexidine | FDA-approved for withdrawal symptoms |

### Psychosocial Treatment

#### Recommendations
| Intervention | Details |
|--------------|---------|
| Counseling | Should be offered but not required for medication |
| CBT | Evidence-based |
| Contingency management | Effective for retention |
| 12-step programs | Supportive, not substitute for medication |

### Special Populations

#### Pregnancy
| Recommendation | Details |
|----------------|---------|
| MOUD continuation | Do not discontinue during pregnancy |
| Preferred medications | Buprenorphine or methadone |
| Neonatal opioid withdrawal | Anticipated, treatable |
| Breastfeeding | Generally safe with MOUD |

#### Adolescents
| Recommendation | Details |
|----------------|---------|
| Age considerations | Medications appropriate for adolescents with OUD |
| Consent | Follow state-specific regulations |
| Psychosocial support | Particularly important |

#### Co-Occurring Pain
| Recommendation | Details |
|----------------|---------|
| Integrated approach | Address both OUD and pain |
| Buprenorphine | May provide analgesia |
| Methadone | Split dosing for analgesia |
| Non-opioid adjuncts | Maximize multimodal approach |

#### Co-Occurring Psychiatric Disorders
| Recommendation | Details |
|----------------|---------|
| Integrated treatment | Address both conditions |
| MOUD | Does not preclude psychiatric medications |
| Monitoring | For medication interactions |

#### Criminal Justice Involvement
| Recommendation | Details |
|----------------|---------|
| Access | Should not be denied based on legal status |
| Pre-release initiation | Reduces post-release overdose risk |
| Community linkage | Essential for continuity |

### Naloxone for Overdose Prevention

#### Recommendations
| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Prescribe to | All patients at risk, including those on MOUD |
| Education | Overdose recognition and response |
| Family/contacts | Include in education and distribution |
| Formulations | Intranasal, intramuscular options |

### Duration of Treatment

#### Recommendations
- Indefinite duration for most patients
- Discuss risks of discontinuation
- Gradual taper if discontinued
- Relapse common after discontinuation

### Monitoring

#### Ongoing Assessment
| Component | Frequency |
|-----------|-----------|
| Clinical assessment | Each visit |
| Urine drug screening | Per clinical judgment |
| Treatment response | Regularly assess goals |
| Side effects | Ongoing monitoring |
