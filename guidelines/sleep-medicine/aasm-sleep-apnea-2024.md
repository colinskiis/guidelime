## Scope

This guideline provides updated recommendations for diagnostic testing for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in adults with suspected sleep-disordered breathing.

## Key Recommendations

### Clinical Assessment
- Assess for OSA symptoms: Snoring, witnessed apneas, excessive daytime sleepiness
- STOP-BANG, Epworth Sleepiness Scale for screening
- Evaluate comorbidities increasing OSA risk (obesity, hypertension, heart failure)

### Polysomnography (PSG)
- Gold standard for OSA diagnosis
- Indicated for suspected OSA with significant comorbidities
- Measures AHI, oxygen desaturation, sleep architecture
- Required for CPAP titration in complex cases

### Home Sleep Apnea Testing (HSAT)
- Acceptable alternative for uncomplicated OSA
- Use when moderate-to-high pretest probability
- Type III or IV devices
- Not recommended if significant comorbidities (heart failure, severe pulmonary disease, neuromuscular disease)

### Diagnostic Criteria
- OSA: AHI ≥5 with symptoms OR AHI ≥15 regardless of symptoms
- Mild: AHI 5-14
- Moderate: AHI 15-29
- Severe: AHI ≥30

### When to Repeat Testing
- Negative HSAT with high clinical suspicion: Proceed to PSG
- Significant clinical changes after treatment initiation
- Post-surgical re-evaluation

### Special Populations
- Elderly: PSG preferred due to comorbidities
- Cardiovascular disease: PSG recommended
- Obesity hypoventilation: PSG with CO2 monitoring

### Treatment Initiation
- CPAP remains first-line for moderate-to-severe OSA
- Auto-titrating CPAP acceptable for uncomplicated cases
- Follow-up to assess adherence and efficacy
