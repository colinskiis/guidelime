## Scope
2024 AASM clinical practice guideline update on the pharmacological treatment of restless legs syndrome (RLS) / Willis-Ekbom disease in adults.

## Key Recommendations

### Iron Supplementation
- **Check serum ferritin** in all patients with RLS.
- **Iron therapy recommended** if ferritin ≤75 μg/L (some guidelines suggest ≤100).
- Oral iron (ferrous sulfate 325 mg with vitamin C on empty stomach) OR IV iron if oral is ineffective or not tolerated.

### First-Line Pharmacotherapy

#### Alpha-2-Delta Ligands (Preferred for Chronic RLS)
- **Gabapentin Enacarbil (Horizant)**: FDA-approved for RLS. STRONGLY recommended.
- **Pregabalin**: STRONGLY recommended.
- Gabapentin (off-label): May be used.
- Lower risk of augmentation compared to dopamine agonists.

#### Dopamine Agonists
- **Pramipexole, Ropinirole, Rotigotine Patch**: Effective but risk of augmentation with long-term use.
- Use lowest effective dose.
- Monitor for augmentation (earlier symptom onset, increased intensity, spread to other body parts).

### Second-Line / Refractory RLS
- Opioids (oxycodone, methadone, tramadol): Consider for severe/refractory RLS not responding to first-line agents. Specialist management.

### Avoid / Limit
- High-dose or long-term dopamine agonists (augmentation risk).
- Antihistamines, antidepressants (SSRIs, SNRIs, mirtazapine) can worsen RLS.

### Non-Pharmacological
- Sleep hygiene, moderate exercise, avoidance of caffeine and alcohol.
- Treat underlying conditions (iron deficiency, renal disease).
