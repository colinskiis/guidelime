## Scope
Clinical practice recommendations for positive airway pressure (PAP) treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in adults.

## Key Recommendations

### Indications for PAP Therapy

#### Strong Recommendations
- PAP for OSA with **excessive sleepiness** (Strong)
- PAP for OSA with **impaired sleep-related quality of life** (Strong)

#### Conditional Recommendations
- PAP for OSA with **comorbid hypertension** (Conditional)
- PAP may improve cardiovascular outcomes in select patients

### PAP Initiation

#### Methods (Strong)
Either approach acceptable:
1. **APAP at home**: Auto-titrating PAP for initial therapy
2. **In-laboratory PAP titration**: Attended polysomnography

#### Patient Selection for APAP at Home
Appropriate if:
- Moderate to severe OSA
- No significant comorbidities (CHF, COPD, central sleep apnea, hypoventilation)

In-lab titration preferred for:
- Complex sleep apnea
- Significant cardiopulmonary disease
- Nocturnal hypoxemia from other causes
- Failed APAP

### PAP Modalities

#### CPAP vs APAP (Strong)
- Either CPAP or APAP appropriate for ongoing treatment
- Similar efficacy in most patients
- APAP may improve comfort for some

#### CPAP/APAP vs BPAP (Conditional)
- Recommend CPAP or APAP over BPAP for routine OSA treatment
- BPAP reserved for:
  - CPAP intolerance
  - Concurrent hypoventilation
  - Need for higher pressures

### Patient Education (Strong)
Educational interventions should be provided at PAP initiation:
- Device operation and maintenance
- Mask fitting and troubleshooting
- Importance of adherence
- Common side effects and solutions
- Follow-up schedule

### Mask Selection
- **Nasal mask**: Often first-line
- **Nasal pillows**: May improve comfort for some
- **Full face mask**: For mouth breathers or nasal obstruction
- Trial different interfaces to optimize comfort and seal

### Adjunctive Measures

#### Heated Humidification
- Recommended for nasal dryness, congestion
- Integrated or standalone humidifiers

#### Expiratory Pressure Relief
- EPR/C-Flex may improve comfort
- Does not significantly affect efficacy

### Adherence Monitoring
- Download PAP data regularly
- Address issues early (mask leak, residual AHI, comfort)
- Medicare requires ≥4 hours/night on 70% of nights

### Follow-Up
- Initial follow-up within 1-3 months
- Assess symptom improvement
- Review adherence data
- Address residual symptoms

### Treatment Alternatives
If PAP intolerance despite optimization:
- Oral appliance therapy (mandibular advancement device)
- Positional therapy (if position-dependent OSA)
- Upper airway surgery
- Hypoglossal nerve stimulation (select candidates)

## Key Points
- PAP is first-line treatment for moderate to severe OSA
- APAP and CPAP equally effective for most patients
- Education and follow-up critical for adherence
- Address side effects promptly to improve compliance
