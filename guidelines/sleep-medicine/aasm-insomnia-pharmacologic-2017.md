## Scope
Evidence-based recommendations for pharmacologic treatment of chronic insomnia disorder in adults.

## Key Recommendations

### General Principles

#### First-Line Treatment
- Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) remains first-line
- Pharmacotherapy for patients who cannot access, tolerate, or prefer not to do CBT-I
- May combine medications with CBT-I

#### Chronic Insomnia Definition
- Difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep
- Occurs ≥3 nights per week for ≥3 months
- Causes daytime impairment
- Adequate opportunity for sleep

### Medication Recommendations

#### Benzodiazepine Receptor Agonists

##### Recommended (Weak)
| Drug | Indication | Notes |
|------|------------|-------|
| Temazepam | Sleep maintenance | Intermediate half-life |
| Triazolam | Sleep onset | Short half-life |
| Eszopiclone | Sleep onset and maintenance | Long half-life |
| Zaleplon | Sleep onset only | Very short half-life |
| Zolpidem | Sleep onset | Short half-life |

##### Dosing Considerations
- Start with lowest effective dose
- Limit duration when possible
- Women may need lower doses (particularly zolpidem)

#### Orexin Receptor Antagonists

##### Recommended (Weak)
| Drug | Dose | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| Suvorexant | 10-20 mg | For sleep onset and maintenance |
| Lemborexant | 5-10 mg | Newer agent |
| Daridorexant | 25-50 mg | Newest agent |

- Novel mechanism (blocks wake-promoting orexins)
- May be used in patients with substance use concerns

#### Melatonin Receptor Agonists

##### Recommended (Weak)
| Drug | Dose | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| Ramelteon | 8 mg | Sleep onset; no abuse potential |

- May be appropriate for patients with contraindication to other agents
- Limited efficacy compared to other hypnotics

#### Doxepin (Low Dose)

##### Recommended (Weak)
- 3-6 mg for sleep maintenance
- Selective H1 antihistamine at low doses
- Minimal anticholinergic effects at low dose
- Not for sleep onset insomnia

### Medications Not Recommended

#### Insufficient Evidence to Recommend
| Drug | Reason |
|------|--------|
| Trazodone | Insufficient evidence despite common use |
| Diphenhydramine | Insufficient evidence; anticholinergic effects |
| Melatonin | Insufficient evidence in chronic insomnia |
| Valerian | Insufficient evidence |

#### Specifically Not Recommended
| Drug | Concern |
|------|---------|
| L-tryptophan | Insufficient evidence |
| Tiagabine | Adverse effects outweigh benefit |

### Special Considerations

#### Elderly Patients
- Start with lower doses
- Consider fall risk
- Avoid long-acting agents
- Monitor for cognitive effects

#### Comorbid Conditions
| Condition | Considerations |
|-----------|---------------|
| Depression | Trazodone or doxepin may be appropriate |
| Substance use | Avoid BzRAs; consider orexin antagonists |
| Sleep apnea | Treat OSA; caution with sedatives |
| Restless legs | Treat underlying RLS |
| GERD | Elevate head of bed; treat reflux |

#### Pregnancy and Lactation
- Limited safety data for most agents
- Avoid if possible
- Consult with OB if medication needed

### Duration of Treatment

#### Acute/Short-Term
- 2-4 weeks for transient insomnia
- Re-evaluate need

#### Chronic Use
- May be appropriate in some patients
- Regular reassessment
- Lowest effective dose
- Consider intermittent use

### Discontinuation

#### Tapering
- Gradual dose reduction
- May take weeks to months
- Rebound insomnia possible
- CBT-I during taper may help

### Adverse Effects to Monitor

#### Common Concerns
| Effect | Associated Agents |
|--------|-------------------|
| Next-day sedation | All sedative-hypnotics |
| Falls | Particularly in elderly |
| Complex sleep behaviors | BzRAs, orexin antagonists |
| Tolerance | BzRAs |
| Dependence | BzRAs |

### FDA Warnings
- Lower doses of zolpidem for women
- Black box warning for complex sleep behaviors (BzRAs)
- Sleep driving, cooking, etc.
