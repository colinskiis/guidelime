## Scope
First AASM clinical practice guideline providing recommendations for evaluation and management of obstructive sleep apnea in medically hospitalized adults.

## Key Recommendations

### Background

#### Rationale for Guideline
| Factor | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Prevalence | High prevalence of OSA in hospitalized patients |
| Outcomes | OSA associated with worse inpatient outcomes |
| Length of stay | 17% increased length of stay |
| Costs | 67% increased costs |
| Gap | Previously no inpatient-specific guidance |

### Screening

#### Recommendation
- For medically hospitalized adults at increased risk for OSA, suggest in-hospital screening as part of evaluation and management pathway

#### Risk Factors for OSA
| Risk Factor | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| Obesity | BMI ≥30 kg/m² |
| Male sex | Higher prevalence |
| Older age | Increasing with age |
| Neck circumference | >17 inches (men), >16 inches (women) |
| Craniofacial abnormalities | Retrognathia, large tonsils |
| Snoring | Loud, frequent |
| Witnessed apneas | Reported by bed partner |
| Daytime sleepiness | Excessive |

#### Screening Tools
| Tool | Notes |
|------|-------|
| STOP-Bang | Commonly used, validated |
| Epworth Sleepiness Scale | Assesses sleepiness |
| Berlin Questionnaire | Alternative option |

### Diagnosis

#### Testing Considerations
| Setting | Recommendation |
|---------|----------------|
| Inpatient testing | Consider if will change management |
| Home sleep testing | May be arranged at discharge |
| Polysomnography | Gold standard, often outpatient |

### Treatment in Hospital

#### Patients with Established OSA
| Status | Recommendation |
|--------|----------------|
| Currently on PAP | Continue PAP during hospitalization |
| Moderate-severe OSA, not on treatment | Consider inpatient PAP initiation |
| Mild OSA | Individualized decision |

#### PAP During Hospitalization
| Consideration | Details |
|---------------|---------|
| Own device | Encourage patients to bring home PAP |
| Hospital equipment | Available if needed |
| Settings | Use home settings if known |
| Monitoring | Ensure proper use |

#### Perioperative Management
| Phase | Recommendation |
|-------|----------------|
| Preoperative | Identify OSA, document severity |
| Intraoperative | Alert anesthesia team |
| Postoperative | Continuous monitoring, PAP when awake |
| Recovery | Resume PAP as soon as able |

### Discharge Planning

#### Recommendation
- For hospitalized adults at increased risk for or with established OSA, suggest discharge management plan to ensure timely diagnosis and effective management

#### Components
| Element | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Follow-up appointment | Sleep medicine or primary care |
| Testing referral | Sleep study if not yet diagnosed |
| Equipment coordination | PAP setup if prescribed |
| Patient education | Importance of treatment adherence |

### Special Considerations

#### Supplemental Oxygen
| Consideration | Details |
|---------------|---------|
| Oxygen alone | Does not treat obstruction |
| PAP + oxygen | Appropriate when both indicated |
| Monitoring | Watch for hypoventilation |

#### Sedation and Analgesia
| Recommendation | Details |
|----------------|---------|
| Opioids | Use with caution; respiratory depression |
| Sedatives | Minimize use |
| Monitoring | Enhanced monitoring recommended |
| Positioning | Avoid supine if possible |

#### Cardiac Conditions
| Condition | Consideration |
|-----------|---------------|
| Heart failure | High OSA prevalence |
| Atrial fibrillation | OSA common, treatment may help |
| Acute coronary syndrome | OSA screening appropriate |

### Quality Improvement

#### Metrics to Consider
| Metric | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Screening rate | Proportion screened |
| Treatment initiation | PAP started when indicated |
| Discharge planning | Documentation of follow-up |

### Multidisciplinary Approach

#### Team Members
| Discipline | Role |
|------------|------|
| Sleep medicine | Consultation, testing |
| Nursing | Screening, PAP assistance |
| Respiratory therapy | PAP setup and troubleshooting |
| Hospitalist/Primary team | Ordering, coordination |
