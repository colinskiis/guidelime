## Scope
New comprehensive evidence-based recommendations for clinicians treating older adults (typically ≥65 years) with AML, addressing the assessment of fitness, selection of therapy, and integration of supportive and palliative care.

## Key Recommendations

### Assessment of Fitness
- **Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA)**: Recommended for all older adults with AML to assess functional status, comorbidities, and cognitive function.
- **Fitness Classification**: Use objective tools to categorize patients as "fit for intensive therapy," "fit for non-intensive therapy," or "unfit for leukemia-directed therapy."

### Treatment Selection (Non-intensive)
- **HMA + Venetoclax**: Recommended as the standard of care for older adults who are not candidates for intensive chemotherapy (e.g., 7+3).
- **Maintenance**: In patients achieving remission with non-intensive therapy, continued treatment is recommended to delay relapse.

### Treatment Selection (Intensive)
- **Selection**: Intensive induction should only be offered to older adults with favorable or intermediate-risk cytogenetics who have high functional status (ECOG 0-1) and minimal comorbidities.

### Goal-Concordant Care
- **Discussion**: Clinicians must engage in early and ongoing discussions about patient values, treatment goals (e.g., survival vs. quality of life), and the expected outcomes of different therapeutic paths.
- **Palliative Care**: Early integration of palliative care is recommended regardless of the plan for leukemia-directed therapy.

### Supportive Care
- **Transfusion Support**: Proactive and individualized transfusion strategy.
- **Infection Prophylaxis**: Use of antifungal, antiviral, and antibacterial prophylaxis based on the specific treatment regimen and local resistance patterns.
