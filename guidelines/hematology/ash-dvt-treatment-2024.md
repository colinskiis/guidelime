## Scope
2024 ASH guideline update on the treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in adults.

## Key Recommendations

### Anticoagulation (First-Line)
- **DOACs (Apixaban, Rivaroxaban, Edoxaban, Dabigatran)**: Preferred over warfarin for most patients with proximal DVT.
  - Apixaban and rivaroxaban: Single-drug approach (no lead-in with parenteral anticoagulation).
  - Edoxaban and dabigatran: Require 5-7 days of parenteral anticoagulation (LMWH or UFH) before starting oral agent.
- **Warfarin**: Alternative if DOACs are contraindicated, not available, or for certain conditions (antiphospholipid syndrome, mechanical valves).

### Duration of Anticoagulation
- **Provoked DVT (Transient Risk Factor)**: 3 months.
- **Unprovoked DVT**: At least 3 months; consider extended/indefinite anticoagulation if bleeding risk is low (annual reassessment).
- **Cancer-Associated DVT**: Extended anticoagulation while cancer is active; DOAC (apixaban, edoxaban, rivaroxaban) preferred over LMWH in most; avoid DOACs in high GI bleed risk cancers.

### Thrombolysis
- **Catheter-Directed Thrombolysis (CDT)**: May be considered for extensive iliofemoral DVT with severe symptoms and low bleeding risk to reduce post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS). Not routinely recommended.
- **Systemic Thrombolysis**: Generally NOT recommended for DVT.

### IVC Filters
- Only for patients with acute proximal DVT who have an absolute contraindication to anticoagulation.
- Retrievable filters preferred; remove when anticoagulation can be safely resumed.

### Compression Therapy
- Graduated compression stockings (GCS) for symptom management of acute DVT and patients with PTS.
- Routine use for PTS prevention is no longer strongly recommended based on recent evidence.

### Monitoring
- No routine coagulation monitoring needed for DOACs.
- For warfarin: Target INR 2-3.
