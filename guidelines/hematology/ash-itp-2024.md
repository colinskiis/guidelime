## Scope
2024 ASH guideline update on the diagnosis and management of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in adults.

## Key Recommendations

### Diagnosis
- ITP is a diagnosis of exclusion.
- CBC with peripheral smear: Isolated thrombocytopenia (<100,000/μL), normal WBC and RBC.
- Exclude secondary causes: Drug-induced, viral (HCV, HIV), autoimmune (SLE), bone marrow failure, pseudothrombocytopenia.

### When to Treat
- Treatment decisions based on bleeding risk and symptoms, not platelet count alone.
- Many patients with platelet >30,000/μL and no bleeding can be observed.
- Treat if significant bleeding, platelet count <20,000-30,000/μL, or high bleeding risk (surgery, anticoagulation need).

### First-Line Therapy
- **Corticosteroids**: Prednisone 1 mg/kg/day x 1-2 weeks then taper, OR dexamethasone 40 mg/day x 4 days.
- Short courses preferred to minimize toxicity.
- **IVIG**: For faster platelet rise (before surgery, severe bleeding) or if corticosteroids contraindicated.

### Second-Line Therapy (Persistent/Chronic ITP)

#### Thrombopoietin Receptor Agonists (TPO-RA)
- **Romiplostim (Nplate)**, **Eltrombopag (Promacta)**, **Avatrombopag (Doptelet)**: Stimulate platelet production. Highly effective. Often preferred second-line.

#### Rituximab
- Anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody. ~60% initial response, but durable responses less common.

#### Splenectomy
- Traditionally effective (~65% long-term response). Reserved for refractory cases due to surgical risks and loss of TPO-RA option post-splenectomy in some guidelines.

### Third-Line / Refractory ITP
- Fostamatinib (Syk inhibitor).
- Immunosuppressants: Mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine, cyclosporine.
- Combination therapies.

### Emergency Management (Severe Bleeding)
- IV corticosteroids + IVIG ± platelet transfusion ± tranexamic acid.
