## Scope
2024 update to the ASH guidelines on VTE prophylaxis in acutely ill hospitalized medical patients.

## Key Recommendations

### Risk Assessment
- Use a validated risk assessment model (e.g., Padua, IMPROVE) to identify patients at elevated VTE risk who would benefit from prophylaxis.
- Also assess bleeding risk (IMPROVE Bleeding Risk Score).

### Pharmacological Prophylaxis
- **Recommendation**: For acutely ill hospitalized medical patients at increased VTE risk and acceptable bleeding risk, use pharmacological prophylaxis.
- **Preferred Agents**: Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH, e.g., enoxaparin) or unfractionated heparin (UFH) are recommended.
- **Fondaparinux**: An alternative for patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) history.
- **DOACs Not Recommended**: Direct oral anticoagulants for inpatient prophylaxis are NOT routinely recommended due to increased bleeding risk without significant VTE reduction.

### Mechanical Prophylaxis
- For patients at high bleeding risk or with contraindications to anticoagulants, use mechanical prophylaxis (intermittent pneumatic compression, IPC).
- Combination of mechanical + pharmacological prophylaxis may be considered for very high-risk patients, though evidence is limited.

### Duration
- Prophylaxis during hospitalization. Extended post-discharge prophylaxis is NOT routinely recommended for most medical patients due to lack of net clinical benefit.

### Special Populations
- **Critical Illness**: Pharmacological prophylaxis is recommended.
- **Stroke**: Prophylaxis recommendations differ by stroke type and mobility.
- **COVID-19 Hospitalization**: Standard-dose prophylaxis is generally recommended; therapeutic dosing may be considered in select high-risk patients with close monitoring.
