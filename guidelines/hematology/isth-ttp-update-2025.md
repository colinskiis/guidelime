## Scope
2025 focused update of the 2020 ISTH guidelines, providing updated recommendations for the diagnosis and management of acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP).

## Key Recommendations

### Diagnosis
- **ADAMTS13 Activity**: ADAMTS13 activity <10% is diagnostic for immune TTP. Should be collected PRIOR to initiating plasma exchange (PEX) or transfusion.
- **PLASMIC Score**: Can be used for rapid risk stratification while awaiting ADAMTS13 results to guide early initiation of therapy.

### Initial Treatment
- **Standard of Care**: The initial treatment triad is:
  1. **Therapeutic Plasma Exchange (TPE)**: Must be initiated as soon as the diagnosis is suspected.
  2. **Corticosteroids**: High-dose steroids (e.g., methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg/day or equivalent) are started immediately.
  3. **Caplacizumab**: Recommended as an add-on to TPE and steroids from the first episode of immune TTP. It significantly reduces time to platelet normalization, refractory disease, and mortality.

### Immunosuppression
- **Rituximab**: Recommended early in the treatment course (e.g., within the first week) for most patients with immune TTP to promote sustained remission and prevent relapse.
- **Monitoring ADAMTS13 for Relapse**: Serial monitoring of ADAMTS13 activity is recommended to detect subclinical relapse and guide preemptive immunosuppression.

### Management of Refractory/Relapsed TTP
- **Refractory TTP**: Consider more intense PEX schedules, additional immunosuppression (e.g., Mycophenolate Mofetil, Cyclosporine), or splenectomy in rare cases.
- **Relapse Prevention**: Patients with persistently low ADAMTS13 activity (<10%) or history of relapse may benefit from preemptive rituximab or maintenance immunosuppression.

### Pregnancy-Associated TTP
- Management is similar to non-pregnant individuals; caplacizumab and rituximab data in pregnancy are limited but may be considered in severe cases after risk-benefit discussion.
