## Scope
2024 ASH guideline update on the management of acute vaso-occlusive crisis (pain crisis) in patients with sickle cell disease.

## Key Recommendations

### Assessment
- Rapid triage and comprehensive pain assessment.
- Rule out complications: Acute chest syndrome, splenic sequestration, stroke, priapism, infection.

### Pain Management

#### Opioids (First-Line for Moderate-Severe Pain)
- Administer within 30 minutes of arrival.
- Use patient-specific protocols when available; avoid delays in treatment.
- **IV Morphine, Hydromorphone**: Common choices. PCA (patient-controlled analgesia) may improve control.
- Avoid meperidine (seizure risk with metabolite accumulation).
- Reassess pain frequently (every 15-30 minutes until controlled).

#### Adjunct Analgesics
- **NSAIDs (Ketorolac, Ibuprofen)**: Use unless contraindicated (renal impairment).
- **Acetaminophen**: Adjunct.
- Consider ketamine (sub-dissociative doses) for refractory pain.

### Hydration
- IV fluids (isotonic crystalloid) at maintenance or slightly above; avoid overhydration (risk of ACS).

### Oxygen
- Administer if hypoxic (SpO2 <95%). Do not routinely use in non-hypoxemic patients.

### Incentive Spirometry
- Encourage regularly to prevent atelectasis and acute chest syndrome.

### Transfusion
- Not routine for uncomplicated VOC.
- Consider if severe anemia worsening, concurrent ACS, or stroke.

### Monitoring
- Watch for ACS (fever, respiratory symptoms, new pulmonary infiltrate).
- Monitor for opioid side effects (sedation, respiratory depression, constipation).

### Discharge
- Transition to oral analgesics when pain controlled.
- Ensure follow-up and optimize disease-modifying therapy (hydroxyurea, voxelotor, crizanlizumab, L-glutamine).
