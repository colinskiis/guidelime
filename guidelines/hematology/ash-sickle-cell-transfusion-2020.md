## Scope
Evidence-based recommendations for transfusion therapy in sickle cell disease, including indications, administration, and management of complications.

## Key Recommendations

### Indications for Transfusion

#### Acute Indications
- Acute chest syndrome
- Acute stroke
- Acute splenic sequestration
- Aplastic crisis with symptomatic anemia
- Preoperative for high-risk surgeries

#### Chronic Transfusion Therapy
- Primary and secondary stroke prevention (abnormal TCD)
- Severe recurrent acute chest syndrome
- Severe recurrent vaso-occlusive crises unresponsive to hydroxyurea

### Transfusion Methods

#### Simple Transfusion
- Appropriate for most acute indications
- Goal Hgb typically 9-10 g/dL
- Avoid Hgb >10-11 g/dL (hyperviscosity risk)

#### Exchange Transfusion
- Preferred for acute stroke
- Severe acute chest syndrome
- Preoperative when HbS reduction needed urgently
- Goal: HbS <30% for stroke, <30-50% for other indications

### Alloimmunization Prevention
- **Extended antigen matching** recommended (C, E, K at minimum)
- Consider prophylactic matching for Rh (C, c, E, e) and Kell systems
- Use of sickle-negative units

### Delayed Hemolytic Transfusion Reactions (DHTR)
- High index of suspicion in SCD patients with post-transfusion anemia
- May present with pain crisis, hyperbilirubinemia
- Avoid further transfusions if possible unless life-threatening anemia
- Consider IVIG, steroids, rituximab for severe cases

### Iron Overload Management
- Monitor ferritin regularly in chronically transfused patients
- Liver iron concentration (LIC) assessment when indicated
- Chelation therapy: deferasirox, deferoxamine, or deferiprone

### Recurrent Acute Pain
- **Against** long-term monthly transfusion as first-line for recurrent pain
- Consider only after failure of hydroxyurea and other disease-modifying therapies
