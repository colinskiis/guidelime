## Scope
2024 ASH guideline update on the use of hydroxyurea (HU) in children and adults with sickle cell disease (SCD).

## Key Recommendations

### Indications
- **Strong Recommendation**: Offer hydroxyurea to all children with sickle cell anemia (HbSS or HbSβ0-thalassemia) starting at 9 months of age, regardless of clinical severity.
- Offer hydroxyurea to adults with HbSS or HbSβ0-thalassemia who have frequent vaso-occlusive crises (VOC), acute chest syndrome (ACS), or symptomatic anemia.

### Mechanism
- Hydroxyurea increases fetal hemoglobin (HbF), which inhibits HbS polymerization and reduces sickling.

### Clinical Benefits
- Reduces frequency and severity of VOC.
- Reduces incidence of ACS.
- Reduces need for blood transfusions.
- May reduce risk of stroke in select patients.
- Improves overall survival.

### Dosing
- Start at 15-20 mg/kg/day and titrate to maximum tolerated dose (MTD, typically 25-35 mg/kg/day) based on marrow response (goal: mild myelosuppression).
- Monitor CBC every 4-8 weeks during dose escalation.

### Monitoring
- Regular monitoring for myelosuppression (ANC, hemoglobin, platelets).
- Assess HbF levels and MCV as markers of adherence and response.

### Adverse Effects
- Myelosuppression (reversible with dose reduction).
- Teratogenicity: Contraceptive counseling required. Generally avoided during pregnancy.

### Alternative/Complementary Therapies
- L-glutamine, crizanlizumab, voxelotor are adjunctive or alternative disease-modifying therapies for those intolerant or unresponsive to HU.
- Gene therapy (approved therapies: exagamglogene autotemcel, lovotibeglogene autotemcel) for eligible patients.
