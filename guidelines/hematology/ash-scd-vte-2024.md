## Scope

This guideline provides recommendations for the prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD).

## Key Recommendations

### VTE Risk in SCD
- Increased VTE risk compared to general population
- Hospitalization further elevates risk
- Recurrence rates higher in SCD

### Prevention
**Hospitalized Patients:**
- Pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis for acutely ill medical patients (conditional)
- Extended prophylaxis after discharge: Insufficient evidence for routine use

**Surgical Patients:**
- Standard VTE prophylaxis per general surgical guidelines

### Acute VTE Treatment
- Anticoagulation as in general population
- LMWH, fondaparinux, or DOACs acceptable
- Duration: Minimum 3 months for provoked VTE
- Unprovoked VTE: Extended anticoagulation considered

### Catheter-Associated Thrombosis
- Anticoagulation without routine catheter removal if functional
- Duration: Minimum 3 months or while catheter in place

### Special Considerations
- Pain crisis vs. pulmonary embolism differentiation challenging
- Low threshold for imaging with respiratory symptoms
- D-dimer often elevated at baseline--limited utility
- Transfusion may be beneficial concurrently

### IVC Filter
- Not routinely recommended
- Consider only if anticoagulation absolutely contraindicated
