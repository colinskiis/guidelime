## Scope

This guideline provides recommendations for the treatment of adults with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, including transplant-eligible and transplant-ineligible patients.

## Key Recommendations

### Transplant-Eligible Patients
**Induction Therapy:**
- VRd (bortezomib, lenalidomide, dexamethasone) - preferred
- Quadruplet adding daratumumab (Dara-VRd) for high-risk disease
- 4-6 cycles before transplant

**Autologous Stem Cell Transplant:**
- Single ASCT following induction
- Tandem ASCT may be considered for high-risk disease

**Consolidation/Maintenance:**
- Lenalidomide maintenance until progression (standard)
- Bortezomib-based maintenance for high-risk cytogenetics

### Transplant-Ineligible Patients
**Standard Risk:**
- Dara-VRd or VRd
- Dara-Rd (daratumumab, lenalidomide, dexamethasone)

**Frail Elderly:**
- Dose-reduced regimens
- Consider Rd (lenalidomide, dexamethasone)
- Prioritize tolerability

### High-Risk Features
- t(4;14), t(14;16), t(14;20), del(17p), gain(1q)
- More intensive quadruplet induction
- Consider consolidation
- Longer maintenance with bortezomib

### Response Assessment
- Serum and urine protein electrophoresis/immunofixation
- Free light chains
- Bone marrow biopsy for CR assessment
- MRD testing for depth of response

### Supportive Care
- Bone protection: Zoledronic acid or denosumab
- VTE prophylaxis with IMiD-based therapy
- Herpes zoster prophylaxis with bortezomib
- Infection prevention: Vaccinations, consider IVIG if hypogammaglobulinemic
