## Scope
Updated evidence-based recommendations for the management of VTE in neonates, children, and adolescents, addressing anticoagulation choice, duration, and management of specific VTE-related complications.

## Key Recommendations

### Use of DOACs in Children
- **Recommendation**: Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs, e.g., rivaroxaban, dabigatran) are now suggested as an alternative to LMWH or VKAs for the treatment of VTE in children who have completed an initial period of parenteral anticoagulation.
- **Evidence**: Based on randomized clinical trials showing comparable efficacy and safety to standard of care in the pediatric population.

### Duration of Anticoagulation
- **Provoked VTE**: For children with a first VTE provoked by a transient risk factor (e.g., central venous catheter, surgery, trauma), 3 months of anticoagulation is generally recommended.
- **Unprovoked VTE**: For children with an unprovoked VTE, 6–12 months of anticoagulation is recommended, with periodic reassessment for long-term therapy.

### Management of Central Venous Catheter (CVC)-Associated VTE
- **Catheter Removal**: The CVC should be removed if it is no longer functional, no longer needed, or if the thrombus is associated with an infected catheter.
- **Anticoagulation with CVC**: If the CVC is needed and remained in place, anticoagulation should continue as long as the CVC is present.

### Neonatal VTE Management
- **LMWH**: Low-molecular-weight heparin remains the preferred anticoagulant for most neonatal VTE cases.
- **Monitoring**: Frequent monitoring of anti-Xa levels is crucial in neonates due to rapid changes in weight and development.

### Thrombolysis
- **Systemic Thrombolysis**: Should be reserved for children with life-threatening or organ-threatening VTE (e.g., massive PE with hemodynamic instability) where the benefit of rapid thrombus resolution outweighs the risk of major bleeding.
