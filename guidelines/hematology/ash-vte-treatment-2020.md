## Scope
Evidence-based recommendations for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) in adults.

## Key Recommendations

### Initial Anticoagulation

#### Drug Selection for DVT/PE
| Recommendation | Strength |
|----------------|----------|
| DOACs preferred over VKA | Conditional |
| DOACs preferred over LMWH | Conditional |
| Apixaban or rivaroxaban over LMWH lead-in | Conditional |

#### Direct Oral Anticoagulants (DOACs)
| Drug | Initial Dose | Maintenance Dose |
|------|-------------|------------------|
| Apixaban | 10 mg BID × 7 days | 5 mg BID |
| Rivaroxaban | 15 mg BID × 21 days | 20 mg daily |
| Edoxaban | After 5 days LMWH | 60 mg daily |
| Dabigatran | After 5 days LMWH | 150 mg BID |

#### When to Use VKA Over DOAC
- Antiphospholipid syndrome (triple positive)
- Severe renal impairment (CrCl <15-30 mL/min)
- Drug interactions
- Patient preference or cost considerations

### Thrombolysis

#### Pulmonary Embolism
| Clinical Status | Recommendation |
|-----------------|----------------|
| Hemodynamically unstable (massive PE) | Systemic thrombolysis recommended |
| Hemodynamically stable with RV dysfunction | Anticoagulation alone (conditional) |
| Low-risk PE | Anticoagulation alone |

#### DVT
- Systemic thrombolysis not routinely recommended
- Catheter-directed thrombolysis may be considered for limb-threatening DVT

### IVC Filters

#### Recommendations
- Anticoagulation preferred over IVC filter
- IVC filter only if anticoagulation absolutely contraindicated
- Retrievable filter if temporary contraindication
- Continue anticoagulation when safe and retrieve filter

### Duration of Anticoagulation

#### Provoked VTE (Transient Risk Factor)
| Risk Factor | Duration |
|-------------|----------|
| Surgery/immobilization | 3 months |
| Minor transient risk | 3 months |

#### Unprovoked VTE
| Consideration | Recommendation |
|---------------|----------------|
| First unprovoked DVT/PE | Extended anticoagulation (conditional) |
| Recurrent unprovoked VTE | Extended anticoagulation (strong) |
| Major bleeding risk | 3 months then reassess |

#### Extended Anticoagulation Options
- Continue therapeutic dose DOAC
- Reduced-dose DOAC (apixaban 2.5 mg BID, rivaroxaban 10 mg daily)
- VKA (INR 2-3)
- Aspirin (if anticoagulation discontinued)

### Compression Stockings
- Routine use of elastic compression stockings for prevention of PTS: NOT recommended
- May be used for symptom relief

### Subsegmental PE
- Clinical significance uncertain
- Consider patient-specific factors
- May observe without anticoagulation in low-risk patients

### Superficial Vein Thrombosis
- ≥5 cm and close to deep system: Anticoagulation
- Prophylactic-dose fondaparinux × 45 days preferred
- LMWH or rivaroxaban are alternatives

### Upper Extremity DVT
- Anticoagulation for ≥3 months
- Catheter-related: May treat while catheter remains
- Thrombolysis for severe symptoms (limb-threatening)

### Special Populations

#### Cancer-Associated VTE
- LMWH or DOAC preferred over VKA
- Apixaban, edoxaban, rivaroxaban studied
- Duration: Throughout active cancer and treatment
- Consider LMWH for high GI/GU bleeding risk

#### Pregnancy
- LMWH preferred
- DOACs contraindicated
- Continue ≥6 weeks postpartum (minimum 3 months total)
- Warfarin safe during breastfeeding

### Recurrent VTE on Anticoagulation
- Ensure adherence
- Switch anticoagulant class
- LMWH if on DOAC or VKA
- Increase LMWH dose if already on LMWH

### Bleeding Management
- Reversal agents available for DOACs
- Idarucizumab for dabigatran
- Andexanet alfa for anti-Xa agents
- 4-factor PCC as alternative
