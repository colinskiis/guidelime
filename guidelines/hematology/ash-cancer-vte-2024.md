## Scope
2024 ASH guideline update on the treatment and prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with cancer.

## Key Recommendations

### Treatment of Cancer-Associated VTE

#### Initial Therapy
- **DOACs (Preferred for Most Patients)**: Apixaban, edoxaban, rivaroxaban.
  - Superior to or non-inferior to LMWH for recurrence; easier administration.
- **LMWH**: Preferred for high GI bleeding risk (luminal GI/GU malignancies) or significant drug interactions.
- **Warfarin**: Generally NOT recommended due to inferior efficacy and drug interactions.

#### Duration
- **At Least 6 Months**: For all cancer-associated VTE.
- **Extended Anticoagulation**: Continue beyond 6 months while cancer is active or on cancer treatment; reassess periodically.

### Prophylaxis in Ambulatory Cancer Patients
- Routine prophylaxis NOT recommended for all ambulatory patients on chemotherapy.
- **High-Risk Patients (Khorana Score ≥2 + Additional Risk Factors)**: Consider thromboprophylaxis with DOAC (apixaban 2.5 mg BID, rivaroxaban 10 mg daily) if bleeding risk is low.

### Surgical Cancer Patients
- Pharmacologic prophylaxis (LMWH or UFH) pre- and post-operatively.
- Extended prophylaxis (4 weeks) for major abdominal/pelvic cancer surgery.

### Hospitalized Medical Cancer Patients
- Pharmacologic prophylaxis during hospitalization.
- Extended post-discharge prophylaxis: Consider for high-risk patients.

### Incidental VTE
- Treat the same as symptomatic VTE if clinically significant (segmental or larger PE, proximal DVT).
- Subsegmental PE and distal DVT: Individualize based on bleeding risk and tumor burden.

### Recurrent VTE on Anticoagulation
- Ensure adherence; consider switching anticoagulant class or increasing dose.
