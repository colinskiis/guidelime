## Scope
First SAGES guideline on the use of indocyanine green (ICG) near-infrared fluorescence imaging in minimally invasive gastrointestinal surgery.

## Key Recommendations

### General Principles
- **ICG is safe**: It is generally well-tolerated, with a very low risk of allergic reaction (contraindicated in patients with iodine allergy).
- **Standard Dosing**: Dosing varies by application (see below). Administered IV or by direct tissue injection.

### Applications

#### Perfusion Assessment (Colorectal Anastomosis)
- **Recommendation**: ICG angiography may be used to assess bowel perfusion at the anastomotic site during colorectal surgery.
- **Rationale**: May reduce the risk of anastomotic leak by identifying ischemic tissue that should be resected prior to anastomosis.
- **Timing**: Administer ICG IV; visualize fluorescence within 30-60 seconds.

#### Biliary Anatomy (Cholecystectomy)
- **Recommendation**: Near-infrared cholangiography with ICG may be used as an adjunct to critical view of safety (CVS) to visualize the cystic duct and common bile duct during laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
- **Dosing**: ICG administered IV (preoperatively or intraoperatively) is taken up by hepatocytes and excreted into bile.
- **Note**: ICG fluorescence does not replace the need for intraoperative cholangiography if indicated.

#### Lymph Node Mapping (Oncologic Resection)
- **Recommendation**: ICG may be used for sentinel lymph node identification in colorectal and gastric cancer surgery.
- **Method**: Peritumoral injection of ICG.

#### Liver Perfusion and Tumors
- ICG can assist with identification of liver segments, hepatic vein territories, and tumor localization (tumors may fluoresce due to impaired biliary excretion).

### Limitations
- ICG fluorescence is surface-limited; it does not penetrate deeply into tissue.
- Should be used as an adjunct to, not replacement for, sound surgical judgment and established techniques.
