## Scope
2024 update of evidence-based recommendations for best practices to reduce surgical site infections (SSIs) in elective colorectal surgery.

## Key Recommendations

### Preoperative Preparation
- **Mechanical Bowel Prep (MBP) + Oral Antibiotics (OAB)**: The combination of MBP and oral antibiotics (e.g., neomycin + metronidazole or erythromycin base) on the day before surgery is strongly recommended and associated with lower SSI rates than MBP alone or no bowel prep.
- **Chlorhexidine-Alcohol (CHG) Skin Prep**: CHG-based skin antiseptics are recommended over povidone-iodine solutions for preoperative skin preparation.

### Intraoperative Measures
- **IV Antibiotic Prophylaxis**: Administer within 60 minutes of incision. Cefazolin + metronidazole or a second-generation cephalosporin (e.g., cefoxitin) are common choices.
- **Redosing**: Redose IV antibiotics for prolonged procedures (typically every 3-4 hours for cephalosporins).
- **Normothermia**: Active warming to maintain core body temperature ≥36°C.
- **Glycemic Control**: Maintain blood glucose <180 mg/dL perioperatively.
- **Wound Protection**: Use wound protectors during laparotomy.

### Postoperative Measures
- **Antibiotic Duration**: Discontinue prophylactic antibiotics within 24 hours of surgery. There is no benefit to extended postoperative antibiotic courses.
- **Wound Management**: Early removal of dressings (within 24-48 hours) for primarily closed wounds.

### Special Considerations
- **Stapled Anastomosis**: Anastomotic technique (stapled vs. hand-sewn) does not appear to significantly affect SSI rates.
- **Drain Placement**: Prophylactic drain placement does not reduce SSI and is not routinely recommended.
