## Scope
2025 update to the SAGES guideline on the role of peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) in the treatment of achalasia.

## Key Recommendations

### Indications
- POEM is a first-line treatment option for all types of achalasia (Types I, II, and III).
- May be preferred for Type III (spastic) achalasia, where a longer myotomy extending onto the esophageal body is beneficial.
- Can be considered for other spastic esophageal disorders (e.g., jackhammer esophagus, diffuse esophageal spasm) in select cases.

### Comparison with Laparoscopic Heller Myotomy (LHM)
- POEM and LHM are equally effective for relief of dysphagia in short-to-medium-term follow-up.
- POEM has a higher rate of post-procedural gastroesophageal reflux (GERD) because no fundoplication is performed.
- LHM with partial fundoplication remains the standard surgical approach and has more long-term outcome data.

### Patient Selection
- Patients should be counseled on the expected benefits and risks of POEM vs. LHM.
- POEM may be preferred for patients who desire a less invasive approach or have had prior abdominal surgery.
- LHM with fundoplication may be preferred for patients with significant preoperative GERD or hiatal hernia.

### Procedural Technique
- Create a submucosal tunnel in the mid-esophagus, extending distally to include the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) and onto the gastric cardia.
- Perform selective myotomy of the circular muscle fibers.
- Close the mucosal entry site with endoscopic clips or sutures.

### Post-Procedure Management
- Post-procedure GERD management: Proton pump inhibitor therapy is recommended.
- Consider pH monitoring during follow-up to assess for reflux.

### Complications
- Mucosal injury/perforation (usually managed endoscopically).
- Gas-related complications (capnoperitoneum, capnothorax).
- GERD (most common long-term issue).
