## Scope
2024 WSES guideline update on the diagnosis and treatment of acute appendicitis in adults.

## Key Recommendations

### Diagnosis
- **Clinical Assessment**: RLQ pain, migration of pain, anorexia, nausea/vomiting, fever, leukocytosis.
- **Clinical Scores**: Alvarado score, AIR score help stratify probability.
- **Imaging**:
  - **CT Abdomen/Pelvis**: Gold standard. High sensitivity/specificity. Identifies complicated vs. uncomplicated appendicitis.
  - **Ultrasound**: First-line in children, pregnant women, and young adults; operator-dependent.
  - **MRI**: Alternative in pregnancy.

### Classification
- **Uncomplicated Appendicitis**: Inflamed appendix without gangrene, perforation, abscess, or peritonitis.
- **Complicated Appendicitis**: Gangrenous, perforated, abscess, or generalized peritonitis.

### Treatment

#### Uncomplicated Appendicitis
- **Appendectomy (Laparoscopic Preferred)**: Standard of care.
- **Non-Operative Management (Antibiotics Alone)**: May be offered to select patients (uncomplicated, no appendicolith, shared decision-making). ~25-30% will eventually require surgery within 5 years.

#### Complicated Appendicitis
- **Appendectomy**: Indicated for most cases.
- **Periappendicular Abscess**: May consider interval appendectomy after percutaneous drainage and antibiotics in select patients. Early laparoscopic appendectomy is also acceptable.

### Surgical Approach
- **Laparoscopic Appendectomy**: Preferred over open surgery (faster recovery, less wound infection, better visualization).

### Antibiotic Therapy
- Preoperative antibiotics (single dose) reduce surgical site infection.
- For complicated appendicitis: Postoperative antibiotics (typically 3-5 days).

### Special Populations
- **Pregnancy**: Surgery remains standard; antibiotics-only approach carries higher failure risk.
- **Elderly**: Higher risk of perforation; early intervention recommended.
