## Scope
Updated evidence-based guidelines for perioperative care in elective colorectal surgery to optimize recovery and reduce complications.

## Key Recommendations

### Overview

#### ERAS Impact
| Outcome | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Morbidity reduction | 48% reduction |
| Length of stay | 2.5 days shorter median |
| Complications | Reduced postoperative complications |
| Readmission | No increase |

### Preoperative Phase

#### Preadmission Counseling
| Element | Recommendation |
|---------|----------------|
| Patient education | Verbal and written information |
| Expectations | Set realistic recovery goals |
| Active participation | Engage patient in recovery |
| Prehabilitation | Consider exercise/nutrition |

#### Preoperative Optimization
| Factor | Intervention |
|--------|--------------|
| Anemia | Correct before surgery if possible |
| Malnutrition | Nutritional support 7-14 days pre-op |
| Diabetes | Optimize glycemic control |
| Smoking | Cessation 4-8 weeks before surgery |
| Alcohol | Abstinence 4 weeks before surgery |

#### Bowel Preparation
| Recommendation | Details |
|----------------|---------|
| Mechanical + oral antibiotics | Recommended for elective surgery |
| MBP alone | Not recommended |
| Oral antibiotics | Neomycin + metronidazole or erythromycin |
| Timing | Day before surgery |

#### Preoperative Fasting
| Recommendation | Details |
|----------------|---------|
| Solids | 6 hours before anesthesia |
| Clear liquids | 2 hours before anesthesia |
| Carbohydrate loading | Consider evening before and morning of surgery |

#### Thromboprophylaxis
| Recommendation | Details |
|----------------|---------|
| LMWH or UFH | Recommended |
| Timing | Evening before or morning of surgery |
| Duration | Continue until mobilized; extended for high-risk |
| Mechanical | Compression stockings/devices |

### Intraoperative Phase

#### Anesthesia
| Element | Recommendation |
|---------|----------------|
| Regional anesthesia | Thoracic epidural or TAP blocks |
| Short-acting agents | Preferred for rapid recovery |
| Opioid-sparing | Multimodal analgesia |
| BIS monitoring | Consider to avoid awareness |

#### Antimicrobial Prophylaxis
| Recommendation | Details |
|----------------|---------|
| Timing | Within 60 minutes before incision |
| Agent | Cover gram-negative and anaerobes |
| Redosing | Per drug half-life |
| Duration | Single dose or <24 hours |

#### Surgical Approach
| Recommendation | Details |
|----------------|---------|
| Minimally invasive | Preferred when appropriate |
| Laparoscopic/robotic | Associated with faster recovery |
| Incision | Transverse preferred if open |

#### Fluid Management
| Recommendation | Details |
|----------------|---------|
| Goal-directed | Based on hemodynamic monitoring |
| Avoid overload | Restrictive approach |
| Balanced crystalloids | Preferred |
| Vasopressors | To maintain perfusion if needed |

#### Normothermia
| Recommendation | Details |
|----------------|---------|
| Target | Core temperature ≥36°C |
| Active warming | Forced-air warming devices |
| Fluid warming | Warm IV fluids |

#### Nasogastric Tubes
| Recommendation | Details |
|----------------|---------|
| Routine use | Not recommended |
| Postoperative | Remove at end of surgery if placed |

#### Drains
| Recommendation | Details |
|----------------|---------|
| Pelvic drains (rectal) | May be used selectively |
| Abdominal drains (colon) | Generally not recommended |
| Early removal | If drains placed |

### Postoperative Phase

#### Analgesia
| Approach | Details |
|----------|---------|
| Multimodal | NSAIDs + acetaminophen + regional |
| Opioid-sparing | Minimize opioid use |
| Epidural | 48-72 hours if used |
| TAP blocks | Alternative to epidural |
| PCA | Transition if epidural discontinued |

#### Nausea and Vomiting Prevention
| Recommendation | Details |
|----------------|---------|
| Risk assessment | Identify high-risk patients |
| Multimodal prophylaxis | 2+ antiemetics for high-risk |
| Agents | Dexamethasone, ondansetron, droperidol |

#### Ileus Prevention
| Strategy | Details |
|----------|---------|
| Multimodal approach | Multiple interventions |
| Opioid minimization | Reduces ileus risk |
| Gum chewing | May accelerate return of function |
| Early feeding | Does not increase ileus |
| Coffee | May stimulate bowel function |
| Alvimopan | Consider for open surgery |

#### Urinary Catheter
| Recommendation | Details |
|----------------|---------|
| Duration | Remove within 24-48 hours |
| Rectal surgery | May need 1-3 days if low anastomosis |
| Epidural | Can remove with epidural in place |

#### Early Mobilization
| Recommendation | Details |
|----------------|---------|
| Day of surgery | Out of bed if possible |
| POD 1 | Mobilize for 2+ hours |
| Progressive | Increase activity daily |
| PT involvement | As needed |

#### Early Oral Intake
| Recommendation | Details |
|----------------|---------|
| Clear liquids | Day of surgery |
| Regular diet | POD 1 |
| Patient tolerance | Guide advancement |
| Nutritional supplements | Consider if oral intake inadequate |

### Discharge Criteria

#### Readiness for Discharge
| Criterion | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Adequate pain control | On oral analgesics |
| Tolerating oral intake | Solid food |
| Bowel function | Passing gas/stool |
| Mobilizing | Independently |
| No complications | No signs of infection/leak |

#### Follow-Up
| Recommendation | Details |
|----------------|---------|
| Contact information | 24-hour access |
| Early review | If concerns arise |
| Outpatient follow-up | Per surgical protocol |

### Compliance and Audit

#### Recommendations
| Element | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Protocol compliance | Monitor adherence |
| Outcomes tracking | Measure and report |
| Quality improvement | Continuous refinement |
| Multidisciplinary | Team-based implementation |
