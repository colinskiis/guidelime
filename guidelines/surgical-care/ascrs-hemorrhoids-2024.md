## Scope
Comprehensive 2024 update for the evaluation and management of internal and external hemorrhoids in adults.

## Key Recommendations

### Initial Management
- **Dietary Fiber and Hydration**: First-line treatment for Grade I-II internal hemorrhoids. Recommends increasing fiber intake (goal 25-35g/day) and adequate hydration to reduce straining.
- **Topical Agents**: OTC creams and suppositories may provide symptomatic relief but do not address the underlying disease.

### Office-Based Procedures
- **Rubber Band Ligation (RBL)**: The most effective office-based treatment for Grade I-III internal hemorrhoids. Multiple bands can be applied per session.
- **Infrared Coagulation (IRC)**: An alternative for Grade I-II hemorrhoids, particularly in patients on anticoagulation where RBL may carry higher risk.
- **Sclerotherapy**: Can be considered for smaller Grade I-II hemorrhoids.

### Surgical Management
- **Excisional Hemorrhoidectomy**: Recommended for symptomatic Grade III-IV hemorrhoids not responding to office-based procedures, or for large external hemorrhoids.
- **Stapled Hemorrhoidopexy**: An option for Grade III hemorrhoids, though may have higher recurrence rates than excisional techniques.
- **Doppler-Guided Hemorrhoidal Artery Ligation (DGHAL)**: An alternative that may result in less postoperative pain.

### Management of Thrombosed External Hemorrhoids
- **Excision**: Preferred over incision and drainage if presenting within 72 hours of symptom onset, as it is associated with lower recurrence and faster symptom resolution.
- **Conservative Management**: Sitz baths, analgesics, and stool softeners for patients presenting later or who decline excision.

### Special Populations
- **Pregnancy**: Conservative management is preferred. Office procedures can generally be performed safely in the postpartum period if symptoms persist.
- **Immunocompromised Patients**: Higher risk of infectious complications; conservative approaches are favored.
