## Scope
Comprehensive 2025 update from SAGES and AHPBA providing evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis, initial stabilization, and definitive surgical or endoscopic management of iatrogenic bile duct injuries (BDI) occurring during cholecystectomy.

## Key Recommendations

### Intra-operative Management
- **Early Recognition**: If BDI is suspected during cholecystectomy, the procedure should be halted. An intra-operative cholangiogram (IOC) should be performed if the anatomy is unclear.
- **Drainage Only**: If a major injury is suspected and a specialized hepatobiliary surgeon is not available, the recommended approach is to place external drains and terminate the procedure rather than attempting a complex repair.

### Diagnosis and Risk Stratification
- **Strasberg Classification**: Recommends the continued use of the Strasberg classification to describe the location and extent of the injury.
- **Imaging**: MRCP is the preferred non-invasive modality to delineate biliary anatomy. ERCP is recommended if therapeutic intervention (e.g., stenting for a leak) is anticipated.

### Timing of Repair
- **Early vs. Late**: For minor leaks, early endoscopic management is preferred. For major transections requiring reconstruction, "late" repair (typically >6 weeks) after inflammation has subsided is generally associated with better outcomes, unless performed immediately (<72h) by an expert hepatobiliary surgeon.

### Definitive Surgical Repair
- **Hepaticojejunostomy**: Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy (HJ) remains the gold standard for definitive reconstruction of major biliary injuries.
- **Multidisciplinary Approach**: Management should involve an expert interventional radiologist, endoscopist, and hepatobiliary surgeon.

### Long-term Follow-up
- **Biliary Stricture**: Patients require long-term monitoring (years) for the development of anastomotic strictures, which may present as recurrent cholangitis or abnormal LFTs.

### Prevention
- **Critical View of Safety**: Reaffirms the "Critical View of Safety" (CVS) as the mandatory standard for identifying cystic duct and artery before clipping to prevent BDI.
