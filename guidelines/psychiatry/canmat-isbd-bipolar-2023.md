## Scope
Updated evidence-based recommendations for the treatment of bipolar I and II disorder, including acute mania, bipolar depression, and maintenance therapy.

## Key Recommendations

### Acute Mania - First-Line Treatments
Ranked hierarchically based on efficacy for mania, depression, relapse prevention, and tolerability:
- Lithium
- Quetiapine
- Divalproex
- Asenapine
- Aripiprazole
- Paliperidone
- Risperidone
- Cariprazine

### Acute Bipolar Depression - First-Line Treatments
- Quetiapine
- Lurasidone (adjunct or monotherapy)
- Lithium
- Lamotrigine
- Cariprazine

### Maintenance Therapy - First-Line Treatments
- Lithium
- Quetiapine
- Divalproex
- Lamotrigine
- Asenapine

### Key Clinical Guidance

#### Antidepressants
- **Do NOT use antidepressants as monotherapy** for bipolar I depression
- Risk of treatment-emergent affective switch (mania/hypomania)
- If used, combine with mood stabilizer or atypical antipsychotic

#### Cariprazine (New Evidence)
- Three RCTs demonstrate superior efficacy vs. placebo for bipolar I depression
- Approved for acute mania and bipolar depression

#### ECT (Electroconvulsive Therapy)
- Second-line treatment for:
  - Treatment-refractory bipolar depression
  - Severe depression with imminent suicide risk
  - Catatonia
  - Psychotic depression
  - When rapid response is medically necessary

### Monitoring
- Regular mood monitoring
- Metabolic monitoring for atypical antipsychotics
- Lithium levels and renal/thyroid function
- Valproate levels and liver function
