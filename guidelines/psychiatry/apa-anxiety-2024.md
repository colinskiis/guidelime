## Scope

This guideline provides recommendations for the treatment of anxiety disorders in adults, including generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, and specific phobias.

## Key Recommendations

### Assessment
- Comprehensive psychiatric evaluation
- Rule out medical causes (thyroid, cardiac, substance-related)
- Screen for depression and comorbid conditions
- Suicide risk assessment
- Functional impairment assessment

### Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)
**First-Line Pharmacotherapy:**
- SSRIs (sertraline, paroxetine, escitalopram)
- SNRIs (venlafaxine, duloxetine)

**Psychotherapy:**
- CBT highly effective
- Mindfulness-based therapies

**Second-Line:**
- Buspirone
- Pregabalin (not FDA-approved for GAD in US)

### Panic Disorder
**First-Line:**
- SSRIs or SNRIs
- CBT (including interoceptive exposure)

**Short-Term:**
- Benzodiazepines (short-term for severe symptoms, taper as soon as practical)

### Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia)
**Treatment:**
- SSRIs/SNRIs first-line
- CBT with exposure therapy
- Beta-blockers (performance-only social anxiety)

### Specific Phobias
- Exposure-based CBT is treatment of choice
- Pharmacotherapy generally not first-line

### General Principles
- Combine medication and psychotherapy for optimal outcomes
- Start medications low, titrate gradually
- Monitor for response over 4-8 weeks
- Address comorbid depression/substance use
- Maintenance therapy for chronic/recurrent anxiety

### Benzodiazepine Considerations
- Effective for short-term anxiety relief
- Risk of dependence; avoid long-term use when possible
- Taper gradually if discontinuing
- Avoid in patients with substance use disorder
