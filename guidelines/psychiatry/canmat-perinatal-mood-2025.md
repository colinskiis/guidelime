## Scope
New comprehensive Canadian evidence-based guideline for the screening, diagnosis, and management of mood and anxiety disorders during the perinatal period (pregnancy and up to 12 months postpartum).

## Key Recommendations

### Screening
- **Universal Screening**: Recommended for all individuals during pregnancy and once in the postpartum period using validated tools like the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS).
- **Anxiety**: Specifically screen for anxiety symptoms, which often co-occur with or precede depression in this population.

### Management of Mild-to-Moderate Depression/Anxiety
- **First-line**: Psychotherapy (CBT or Interpersonal Therapy) is recommended as first-line for mild-to-moderate symptoms if accessible.
- **Supportive Interventions**: Exercise, sleep hygiene, and peer support are recommended as valuable adjuncts.

### Management of Moderate-to-Severe Depression
- **Pharmacotherapy**: SSRIs (e.g., sertraline, escitalopram) are typically the first-line pharmacologic choice. 
- **Risk-Benefit**: Emphasizes a personalized risk-benefit discussion, weighing the risks of untreated maternal illness against the potential risks of medication exposure.
- **Sertraline**: Often preferred in the postpartum period due to very low excretion into breast milk.

### Bipolar Disorder
- **Maintenance**: High risk of relapse during pregnancy and postpartum requires careful maintenance of mood stabilizers.
- **Lithium**: Generally recommended to continue if the patient has a history of severe illness, with intensive fetal monitoring (e.g., fetal echo) and frequent serum level checks.

### Implementation of Neurostimulation
- **TMS/ECT**: Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) can be considered for moderate depression in pregnancy. ECT remains a safe and highly effective option for severe, treatment-resistant, or psychotic depression.

### Breastfeeding
- **Compatibility**: Most antidepressants and some mood stabilizers are compatible with breastfeeding.
- **Monitoring**: Close monitoring of the infant for sedation or poor feeding is recommended if the mother is on high doses or multiple medications.
