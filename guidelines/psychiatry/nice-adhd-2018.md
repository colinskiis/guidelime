## Scope
Recommendations for recognizing, diagnosing, and managing ADHD in children, young people, and adults.

## Key Recommendations

### Recognition and Referral

#### When to Suspect ADHD
- Persistent patterns of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity
- Symptoms present in multiple settings
- Significant impact on function
- Present before age 12

#### Referral Pathway
| Age Group | Referral To |
|-----------|-------------|
| Children/Young People | Pediatrician or child psychiatrist |
| Adults | Psychiatrist or specialist ADHD service |

### Diagnosis

#### Diagnostic Criteria
- Use DSM-5 or ICD-11 criteria
- Symptoms in multiple settings (home, school, work)
- Functional impairment
- Exclude other causes

#### Assessment Components
| Component | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Clinical interview | Patient and informant history |
| Rating scales | Multiple informants |
| Observation | Behavior in assessment |
| Developmental history | Early childhood, school performance |
| Medical history | Rule out other conditions |
| Cognitive assessment | If learning difficulties suspected |

#### QbTest (2024 Update)
- May be used as adjunct in ages 6-17
- Computerized continuous performance test
- NOT diagnostic alone

#### Differential Diagnosis
- Anxiety disorders
- Mood disorders
- Autism spectrum disorder
- Learning disabilities
- Sleep disorders
- Substance use

### Non-Pharmacological Management

#### Environmental Modifications
- Structured environment
- Clear expectations
- Minimize distractions
- Regular routines

#### Behavioral Interventions
| Intervention | Target Population |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Parent training programs | Parents of children <12 years |
| CBT | Adolescents and adults |
| Social skills training | Children with social difficulties |

#### Educational Support
- Individual education plan
- Classroom accommodations
- Teacher awareness and training

### Pharmacological Treatment

#### When to Consider Medication
- Moderate-severe ADHD after environmental modifications
- Significant impairment despite non-drug interventions
- May be first-line in severe cases

#### First-Line Medications

##### Children and Adolescents
| Medication | Recommendation |
|------------|----------------|
| Methylphenidate | First-line |
| Lisdexamfetamine | If methylphenidate insufficient response |
| Dexamfetamine | If lisdexamfetamine not tolerated |
| Atomoxetine | If stimulants not suitable or not tolerated |
| Guanfacine | If stimulants/atomoxetine not suitable |

##### Adults
| Medication | Recommendation |
|------------|----------------|
| Lisdexamfetamine | First-line |
| Methylphenidate | First-line alternative |
| Dexamfetamine | If lisdexamfetamine not effective |
| Atomoxetine | If stimulants not suitable |

#### Before Starting Medication
- Baseline assessment (height, weight, BP, pulse)
- Cardiac history
- Family history of cardiac disease
- Screen for substance misuse (adults)
- Consider ECG if cardiac concerns

#### Monitoring on Medication
| Parameter | Frequency |
|-----------|-----------|
| Height and weight | Every 6 months (children) |
| Heart rate and BP | Before dose changes, then every 6 months |
| Side effects | Each visit |
| Effectiveness | Regular review |

#### Common Side Effects
| Medication Class | Side Effects |
|------------------|--------------|
| Stimulants | Appetite suppression, sleep problems, headache, tics |
| Atomoxetine | GI upset, mood changes, sleep problems |
| Guanfacine | Sedation, hypotension, bradycardia |

### Special Populations

#### Preschool Children (Under 5)
- Environmental and behavioral interventions first
- Medication rarely appropriate
- Specialist assessment essential

#### Adults
- Consider undiagnosed ADHD in adults with relevant symptoms
- Transition planning from child services
- Workplace accommodations

#### Pregnancy
- Discuss risks and benefits of medication
- Consider stopping medication
- Monitor closely

#### Comorbidities
| Comorbidity | Consideration |
|-------------|---------------|
| Anxiety/depression | Treat ADHD may help; consider combined treatment |
| Autism | May have both conditions |
| Tic disorders | Stimulants can sometimes worsen tics |
| Substance misuse | Treat ADHD; stimulants generally safe |

### Transition to Adult Services
- Plan transition early (age 14+)
- Joint working between child and adult services
- Ensure continuity of care

### Ongoing Support
- Psychoeducation about ADHD
- Support groups
- Regular medication reviews
- School/workplace liaison

### When to Refer to Specialist
- Diagnostic uncertainty
- Complex comorbidities
- Treatment resistance
- Significant side effects
- Cardiac concerns
