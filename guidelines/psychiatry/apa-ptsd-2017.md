## Scope
Evidence-based recommendations for psychological and pharmacological treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adults.

## Key Recommendations

### Strongly Recommended Psychotherapies
The following interventions have strong evidence for PTSD treatment:
- **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)** - Strongly recommended
- **Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT)** - Strongly recommended
- **Cognitive Therapy** - Strongly recommended
- **Prolonged Exposure (PE)** - Strongly recommended

### Conditionally Recommended Psychotherapies
- **Brief Eclectic Psychotherapy** - Conditionally recommended
- **Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR)** - Conditionally recommended
- **Narrative Exposure Therapy** - Conditionally recommended

### Pharmacotherapy
- **SSRIs and SNRIs** - Conditionally recommended (sertraline, paroxetine, fluoxetine, venlafaxine)
- Medications may be used when trauma-focused psychotherapy is unavailable, not preferred by the patient, or as adjunct to psychotherapy

### Treatment Approach
- Trauma-focused psychotherapy is recommended as first-line treatment
- Individual therapy is preferred over group formats for primary PTSD treatment
- Treatment should be tailored to patient preferences, comorbidities, and clinical context

## 2025 Update
The 2025 updated guideline maintains core recommendations while incorporating new evidence on treatment efficacy and implementation.

## Notes
- This guideline is from the American **Psychological** Association (APA), distinct from the American Psychiatric Association
- The VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline (2023) provides complementary recommendations
