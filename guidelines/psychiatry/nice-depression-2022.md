## Scope
Comprehensive guideline for identifying, treating, and managing depression in adults aged 18 and over, including first episodes, further-line treatments, relapse prevention, and special populations.

## Key Recommendations

### Principles of Care
- Use shared decision-making for all treatment decisions
- Consider patient preferences, previous treatment response, and comorbidities
- Provide information about all treatment options

### Assessment

#### Severity Classification
- **Less severe depression**: PHQ-9 score <16; limited functional impairment
- **More severe depression**: PHQ-9 score ≥16; significant functional impairment

### Treatment of Less Severe Depression

#### First-Line Options (Patient Choice)
- **Guided self-help** based on CBT principles
- **Group CBT**
- **Group behavioral activation**
- **Individual CBT** (if group not preferred)
- **Group exercise**
- **Group mindfulness/meditation**

#### Antidepressants
- **Not routinely first-line** for less severe depression
- Offer if that is the person's preference
- Consider if psychological treatments have not worked

### Treatment of More Severe Depression

#### First-Line Options
- **Individual CBT**
- **Behavioral activation**
- **Antidepressant medication**
- **Combination** of CBT + antidepressant (consider for more severe cases)

### Antidepressant Prescribing

#### Starting Treatment
- Discuss reasons for medication, expected benefits, and side effects
- Provide written information
- Review within 2 weeks of starting (1 week if age 18-25 or suicide risk)

#### Choice of Antidepressant
First-line options (no hierarchy):
- SSRIs: Sertraline, citalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine
- SNRIs: Venlafaxine, duloxetine
- Other: Mirtazapine

#### Switching
- If no response at 4-6 weeks at adequate dose, consider switching
- Can switch within class or to different class
- Follow tapering guidance to avoid discontinuation symptoms

### Chronic/Treatment-Resistant Depression

#### Options to Consider
- Review diagnosis and adherence
- Increase antidepressant dose
- Switch antidepressant
- Combine antidepressant with CBT or behavioral activation
- Augmentation (lithium, antipsychotic)

### Relapse Prevention
- Continue antidepressant for at least 6 months after remission
- Longer duration (2+ years) for recurrent depression or high relapse risk
- Offer mindfulness-based CBT to prevent relapse

### Stopping Antidepressants
- Gradual tapering to minimize discontinuation symptoms
- Taper over at least 4 weeks (longer if on treatment >6 months)
- Slower tapering for paroxetine and venlafaxine

### Special Populations

#### Psychotic Depression
- Combination of antidepressant + antipsychotic, OR
- ECT if severe or treatment-resistant

#### Depression with Chronic Physical Health Problems
- Offer same treatments as for depression alone
- Consider drug interactions and comorbidity management
