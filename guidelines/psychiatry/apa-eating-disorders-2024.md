## Scope
2024 APA clinical practice guideline on the treatment of eating disorders, including anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), and binge eating disorder (BED).

## Key Recommendations

### General Principles
- Multidisciplinary team: Psychiatry, nutrition, primary care, sometimes hospitalization.
- Assess medical complications: Electrolytes, cardiac arrhythmias, refeeding syndrome risk.
- Treat comorbidities: Depression, anxiety, OCD, trauma.

### Anorexia Nervosa

#### Nutritional Rehabilitation
- Primary goal: Weight restoration to a healthy range.
- Structured meal plans; may require NG feeds or inpatient if severe.
- Monitor for refeeding syndrome (phosphate, potassium, magnesium).

#### Psychotherapy
- **Family-Based Treatment (FBT / Maudsley)**: First-line for adolescents.
- **CBT-E, Specialist Supportive Clinical Management (SSCM)**: For adults.

#### Pharmacotherapy
- No medication is FDA-approved for AN.
- SSRIs may help with comorbid anxiety/depression once weight-restored; limited benefit for core AN symptoms.
- Olanzapine may help with weight gain in some patients.

### Bulimia Nervosa

#### Psychotherapy
- **CBT for Bulimia (CBT-BN)**: First-line. Highly effective.
- Interpersonal therapy (IPT) is an alternative.

#### Pharmacotherapy
- **Fluoxetine** (60 mg/day): FDA-approved; reduces binge-purge frequency. Best combined with CBT.

### Binge Eating Disorder

#### Psychotherapy
- **CBT**: First-line.
- Behavioral weight loss programs if obesity is a comorbid goal.

#### Pharmacotherapy
- **Lisdexamfetamine (Vyvanse)**: FDA-approved for BED. Reduces binge days.
- SSRIs, topiramate: Alternatives.

### Hospitalization Criteria
- Hemodynamic instability, severe malnutrition (BMI <15 or rapid decline), suicidal ideation, failure of outpatient treatment.
