## Scope
2024 USPSTF recommendation statement on screening for depression and anxiety in the general adult population, including pregnant and postpartum persons.

## Key Recommendations

### Depression Screening (Grade B)
- **Recommendation**: Screen for major depressive disorder (MDD) in all adults, including pregnant and postpartum persons.
- **Screening Tools**: PHQ-9, PHQ-2 (followed by PHQ-9 if positive), Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) for perinatal population.
- **Frequency**: No specific interval recommended; screen at health maintenance visits and when clinically indicated.

### Anxiety Screening (Grade B)
- **Recommendation**: Screen for anxiety disorders in all adults, including pregnant and postpartum persons. This is a new recommendation added in 2023/2024.
- **Screening Tools**: GAD-7, GAD-2 (followed by GAD-7 if positive).

### Systems for Accurate Diagnosis and Treatment
- Screening is only beneficial if adequate systems are in place for accurate diagnosis, effective treatment, and appropriate follow-up.
- **Collaborative Care Models**: Integrate behavioral health into primary care. Associated with improved outcomes.

### Treatment Options
- Psychotherapy (CBT, interpersonal therapy) and/or pharmacotherapy (SSRIs, SNRIs).
- For perinatal depression, consider safety of medications in pregnancy/lactation; psychotherapy may be preferred first-line.

### Follow-Up
- Patients with positive screens require diagnostic assessment and, if diagnosed, ongoing monitoring and treatment.
