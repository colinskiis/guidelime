## Scope
Major 2024 update to the APA practice guideline for the treatment of borderline personality disorder (BPD), the first comprehensive revision since 2001.

## Key Recommendations

### Psychotherapy (First-Line)
- **Structured, Evidence-Based Psychotherapy**: The cornerstone of treatment.
- **Recommended Modalities**:
  - Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT)
  - Mentalization-Based Treatment (MBT)
  - Transference-Focused Psychotherapy (TFP)
  - Schema-Focused Therapy (SFT)
  - Good Psychiatric Management (GPM)
- Therapy should be provided by clinicians with specialized training.

### Pharmacotherapy (Adjunctive)
- **No FDA-Approved Medications for BPD**: Pharmacotherapy is used symptom-targeted, not as primary treatment.
- **Symptom-Based Target Examples**:
  - Affective dysregulation: Mood stabilizers (e.g., valproate, lamotrigine), some SSRIs.
  - Impulsive aggression: Mood stabilizers, low-dose antipsychotics.
  - Transient psychotic symptoms: Low-dose atypical antipsychotics.
- **Medication Review**: Conduct at least every 6 months; taper and discontinue if not clearly beneficial.

### Crisis Management
- Patients with BPD are at high risk for suicide and self-harm. Crisis planning should be individualized and integrated into treatment.
- Hospitalization should be reserved for acute safety concerns; prolonged hospitalization may be counterproductive.

### Comorbidity
- Assess for and treat common comorbidities (MDD, PTSD, substance use disorders, eating disorders).

### Therapeutic Alliance
- A strong, consistent therapeutic relationship is a key predictor of positive outcomes.
