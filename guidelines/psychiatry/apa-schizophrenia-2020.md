## Scope
Evidence-based recommendations for the treatment of patients with schizophrenia, including pharmacological and psychosocial interventions.

## Key Recommendations

### Antipsychotic Treatment
- **Primary treatment (1A)**: Patients with schizophrenia should be treated with an antipsychotic medication and monitored for effectiveness and side effects
- **Continuation (1A)**: Patients whose symptoms have improved should continue antipsychotic medication
- **Same medication (2B)**: Suggest continuing with the same antipsychotic medication that achieved improvement

### Clozapine
- **Treatment-resistant (1B)**: Patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia should be treated with clozapine
- **Suicide risk (1B)**: Treat with clozapine if suicide risk remains substantial despite other treatments
- **Aggressive behavior (2C)**: Consider clozapine if aggressive behavior risk remains substantial despite other treatments

### Long-Acting Injectables
- **LAI antipsychotics (2B)**: Suggest LAI treatment for patients who prefer it or have history of poor/uncertain adherence

### Tardive Dyskinesia Management
- **VMAT2 inhibitors (1B)**: Patients with moderate to severe or disabling tardive dyskinesia should be treated with a reversible VMAT2 inhibitor

### First Episode Psychosis
- **Coordinated specialty care (1B)**: Patients experiencing first episode psychosis should be treated in a coordinated specialty care program

### Psychosocial Interventions
- **CBTp (1B)**: Patients should be offered cognitive-behavioral therapy for psychosis (CBTp)

## Recommendation Grading
- **1A**: Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence
- **1B**: Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence
- **2B**: Weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence
- **2C**: Weak recommendation, low-quality evidence
