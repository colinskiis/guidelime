## Scope

This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for the pharmacologic and psychosocial treatment of patients with bipolar disorder across mood states.

## Key Recommendations

### Assessment
- Comprehensive psychiatric evaluation
- Medical workup (thyroid, renal, metabolic panel)
- Substance use screening
- Suicide risk assessment
- Functional assessment

### Acute Mania
**First-Line:**
- Lithium + antipsychotic
- Valproate + antipsychotic
- Antipsychotic monotherapy (quetiapine, risperidone, olanzapine, aripiprazole)

**Severe/Psychotic Mania:**
- Combination therapy preferred
- Consider ECT if medication-refractory

### Acute Bipolar Depression
**First-Line:**
- Quetiapine monotherapy
- Lurasidone (with lithium/valproate or monotherapy)
- Lumateperone
- Cariprazine

**Avoid:**
- Antidepressant monotherapy

### Maintenance Treatment
- Continue effective acute treatment
- Lithium: Strong evidence for relapse prevention
- Valproate, lamotrigine, or atypical antipsychotics as alternatives
- Monitor adherence and side effects

### Psychosocial Interventions
- Psychoeducation for patient and family
- Cognitive behavioral therapy
- Interpersonal and social rhythm therapy
- Family-focused therapy

### Monitoring
- Lithium levels (0.6-1.0 mEq/L maintenance; 0.8-1.2 mEq/L acute)
- Renal and thyroid function with lithium
- Metabolic monitoring with antipsychotics
- Weight, glucose, lipids regularly
