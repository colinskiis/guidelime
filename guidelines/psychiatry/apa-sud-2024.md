## Scope
2024 APA clinical practice guideline on the assessment and treatment of substance use disorders (SUDs) in adults, including alcohol, opioid, cannabis, and stimulant use disorders.

## Key Recommendations

### General Principles
- Comprehensive assessment: substance use history, medical/psychiatric comorbidities, social factors, readiness for change.
- Shared decision-making; patient-centered goals (may include abstinence or reduction of harm).
- Combine pharmacotherapy with psychosocial interventions when available.

### Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD)

#### Pharmacotherapy
- **Naltrexone (Oral or IM Extended-Release)**: Reduces heavy drinking days and cravings. First-line.
- **Acamprosate**: Maintains abstinence; useful for patients with renal impairment that precludes naltrexone.
- **Disulfiram**: Deterrent effect; requires patient motivation and daily supervised dosing.
- **Gabapentin, Topiramate**: Off-label, may be helpful adjuncts.

#### Psychosocial
- CBT, motivational enhancement therapy (MET), contingency management, 12-step facilitation.

### Opioid Use Disorder (OUD)

#### Medications for Opioid Use Disorder (MOUD) – Strongly Recommended
- **Buprenorphine (± Naloxone)**: First-line. Office-based prescribing; X-waiver no longer required.
- **Methadone**: Highly effective; requires OTP setting.
- **Naltrexone (IM Extended-Release)**: For patients who prefer opioid-free treatment; requires detoxification first.

#### Harm Reduction
- Naloxone distribution for overdose reversal.
- Fentanyl test strips; syringe exchange.

### Cannabis Use Disorder
- No FDA-approved medications.
- Psychosocial treatments: CBT, motivational interviewing, contingency management.

### Stimulant Use Disorder (Cocaine, Methamphetamine)
- No FDA-approved medications.
- Contingency management is most effective behavioral intervention.
- Emerging: Combination of naltrexone + bupropion (limited evidence).

### Co-Occurring Disorders
- Integrated treatment of SUD and mental health conditions.
