## Scope
2024 APA clinical practice guideline on the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) in adults.

## Key Recommendations

### Initial Assessment
- Comprehensive psychiatric evaluation including suicide risk assessment.
- Assessment of severity (PHQ-9), functional impairment, comorbidities, prior treatment history.
- Screen for bipolar disorder before initiating antidepressant monotherapy.

### Treatment Options

#### Mild-to-Moderate MDD
- **Psychotherapy**: CBT, interpersonal therapy (IPT), behavioral activation are effective.
- **Pharmacotherapy**: SSRIs/SNRIs are first-line.
- Monotherapy with either is acceptable; combination may be considered.

#### Moderate-to-Severe MDD
- **Combination** of pharmacotherapy + psychotherapy is generally preferred.

### Pharmacotherapy

#### First-Line
- **SSRIs**: Sertraline, escitalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine, citalopram.
- **SNRIs**: Venlafaxine, duloxetine.
- Select based on side effect profile, patient preference, cost, and comorbidities.

#### Other Options
- **Bupropion**: Helpful if fatigue, weight gain, or sexual dysfunction concerns.
- **Mirtazapine**: Sedating; useful for insomnia, appetite concern.
- **TCAs, MAOIs**: Reserved for refractory cases.

### Inadequate Response (After 4-8 Weeks at Adequate Dose)
- Switch antidepressant (within or across class).
- Augment with: atypical antipsychotic (aripiprazole, brexpiprazole, cariprazine, quetiapine), lithium, bupropion, buspirone.

### Treatment-Resistant Depression (TRD)
- **Esketamine (Spravato)**: Intranasal, REMS program. For TRD as adjunct to oral antidepressant.
- **IV Ketamine**: Off-label; rapid antidepressant effects.
- **ECT (Electroconvulsive Therapy)**: Highly effective for severe/refractory MDD, catatonia, high suicide risk.
- **TMS (Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation)**: Non-invasive neuromodulation.

### Maintenance
- Continue effective treatment for ≥6-12 months after remission; longer for recurrent MDD.

### Safety Monitoring
- Monitor for suicidal ideation, especially early in treatment in younger patients.
