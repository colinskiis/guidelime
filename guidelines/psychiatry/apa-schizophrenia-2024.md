## Scope

This guideline provides comprehensive recommendations for the pharmacological and psychosocial treatment of schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder.

## Key Recommendations

### Acute Treatment
**Antipsychotic Selection:**
- Second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) preferred initial choice
- Clozapine for treatment-resistant schizophrenia (≥2 adequate trials failed)
- Consider side effect profile, patient preferences, prior response

**First Episode:**
- Lower doses often effective
- Long-acting injectables (LAIs) to reduce relapse risk
- Minimize duration of untreated psychosis

### Maintenance Treatment
- Continue antipsychotic after symptom remission
- At least 1-2 years after first episode
- Indefinite treatment for multiple episodes
- Long-acting injectables strongly recommended for adherence

### Long-Acting Injectables (LAIs)
- Offer early in treatment course
- Do not reserve only for non-adherent patients
- Options: Risperidone, paliperidone, aripiprazole, olanzapine, haloperidol

### Treatment-Resistant Schizophrenia
- Definition: Inadequate response to ≥2 antipsychotics at adequate dose/duration
- Clozapine is the treatment of choice
- Requires monitoring (agranulocytosis, metabolic, cardiac)
- Augmentation strategies if partial clozapine response

### Monitoring
- Metabolic monitoring (weight, glucose, lipids) at baseline and regularly
- Prolactin, QTc for specific agents
- Movement disorder assessment (AIMS for tardive dyskinesia)

### Psychosocial Interventions
- Cognitive behavioral therapy for psychosis (CBTp)
- Family intervention
- Supported employment
- Social skills training
- Assertive community treatment (ACT)

### Comorbidities
- Substance use: Integrated dual-diagnosis treatment
- Depression: Treat with antidepressant if persistent
- Medical conditions: Regular primary care coordination
