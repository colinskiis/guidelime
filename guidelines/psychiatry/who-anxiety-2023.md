## Scope
WHO mhGAP module providing evidence-based recommendations for the management of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and panic disorder (PD) in general health care settings.

## Key Recommendations

### Psychological Interventions
- **Brief structured CBT-based interventions** - Recommended for adults with GAD and/or PD
- Interventions based on principles of cognitive behavioural therapy are first-line treatment
- Can be delivered by trained non-specialist health workers in primary care settings

### Pharmacotherapy
- **SSRIs** - Recommended for GAD and panic disorder when psychological interventions are insufficient or unavailable
- Selection based on patient factors, side effect profile, and local availability

### Stress Management
- **Relaxation and/or mindfulness training** - Recommended for adults with GAD and/or PD
- Structured physical exercise also recommended as adjunctive treatment

### Benzodiazepines
- **Recommend AGAINST routine use** for GAD or panic disorder
- Should only be used for severe, acute anxiety symptoms
- **Maximum duration: 3-7 days** as very short-term measure only
- Risk of dependence and tolerance with longer use

### Stepped Care Approach
1. Psychoeducation and self-help
2. Structured psychological interventions (CBT-based)
3. Pharmacotherapy (SSRIs) if psychological interventions insufficient
4. Specialist referral for treatment-resistant cases

## Implementation Considerations
- Designed for use by general healthcare providers, not only specialists
- Emphasizes task-sharing in resource-limited settings
- Integrates into existing primary care services
- Training materials available through WHO mhGAP program

## Notes
- Part of WHO Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP)
- Updates previous mhGAP recommendations
- Applicable globally with local adaptation
