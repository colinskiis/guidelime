## Scope
First major revision of the WFSBP guidelines for the biological treatment of anxiety disorders, OCD, and PTSD, incorporating a wide body of evidence accumulated since the original 2002-2008 publications.

## Key Recommendations

### Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)
- **First-Line**: SSRIs (e.g., escitalopram, paroxetine, sertraline), SNRIs (e.g., duloxetine, venlafaxine), or pregabalin.
- **Second-Line**: Buspirone, quetiapine XR, or benzodiazepines (short-term due to dependence risk).

### Panic Disorder
- **First-Line**: SSRIs (e.g., escitalopram, citalopram, paroxetine, sertraline) or venlafaxine XR.
- **Augmentation**: Benzodiazepines (e.g., alprazolam, clonazepam) may be used short-term at the start of treatment to manage acute symptoms while waiting for SSRI/SNRI onset.

### Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD)
- **First-Line**: SSRIs (e.g., escitalopram, paroxetine, sertraline) or venlafaxine XR.
- **Alternative**: Pregabalin.
- **PRN for Performance Anxiety**: Beta-blockers (e.g., propranolol) are not recommended for generalized SAD but may help for specific performance situations.

### Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)
- **First-Line**: SSRIs at high doses (often higher than those used for depression).
- **Second-Line/Augmentation**: If SSRIs fail, add low-dose antipsychotics (e.g., risperidone, aripiprazole) as augmentation.
- **Clomipramine**: An alternative first-line, though often reserved for SSRI non-responders due to side effect profile.

### Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)
- **First-Line**: SSRIs (e.g., sertraline, paroxetine) or venlafaxine.
- **Nightmares**: Prazosin (an alpha-1 blocker) may be used as an adjunct for trauma-related nightmares.
- **Benzodiazepines**: Not recommended for PTSD due to lack of efficacy and risk of worsening outcomes.

### General Notes
- Psychotherapy (e.g., CBT, exposure therapy) should be offered in conjunction with pharmacotherapy for all disorders.
