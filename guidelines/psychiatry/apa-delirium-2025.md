## Scope
New comprehensive evidence-based guideline for the detection, prevention, and multidisciplinary management of delirium in hospitalized adults, focusing on non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic interventions.

## Key Recommendations

### Prevention (Preferred Strategy)
- **Multicomponent Non-pharmacologic Interventions**: Strong recommendation for the use of multicomponent interventions for all high-risk patients. These include:
  - Reorientation and cognitive stimulation.
  - Early mobilization.
  - Sleep hygiene (noise reduction, day-light optimization).
  - Use of visual and hearing aids.
  - Adequate hydration and nutrition.
- **Pharmacologic Prevention**: Recommend **against** the routine use of antipsychotics or other medications solely for the prevention of delirium.

### Assessment and Monitoring
- **Universal Screening**: Recommends regular (at least daily) screening for delirium in high-risk patients using validated tools (e.g., CAM, CAM-ICU, 4AT).
- **Subtypes**: Recognition of hyperactive, hypoactive, and mixed subtypes, with a focus on not missing hypoactive delirium.

### Management
- **Non-pharmacologic First**: Non-pharmacologic strategies remain the first-line treatment for all patients with delirium.
- **Pharmacological Management of Symptoms**:
  - **Indications**: Antipsychotics should be reserved for patients with delirium-related distress (e.g., severe agitation, distressing hallucinations) or for those whose symptoms pose a safety risk to themselves or others.
  - **Agents**: Second-generation antipsychotics (e.g., quetiapine, risperidone, olanzapine) are generally preferred over haloperidol due to a lower risk of extrapyramidal symptoms.
  - **Benzodiazepines**: Generally recommend against use unless the delirium is due to alcohol or sedative-hypnotic withdrawal.

### Family and Caregiver Involvement
- **Engagement**: Actively involve family members and caregivers in the prevention and recovery process.
- **Education**: Provide clear information about what delirium is, its reversible nature, and how caregivers can help (e.g., reorientation).

### Transition and Recovery
- **Post-discharge Follow-up**: Ensure continuity of care, as patients with a history of delirium are at increased risk for future cognitive decline and readmission.
- **Medication Review**: Re-evaluate and ideally discontinue any antipsychotics initiated during the delirious episode before or shortly after discharge.
