## Scope
2024 AAO Preferred Practice Pattern update on the diagnosis and management of age-related cataract in adults.

## Key Recommendations

### Indications for Surgery
- Cataract causing visual impairment affecting the patient's quality of life or ability to perform daily activities (driving, reading, etc.).
- Cataract interfering with diagnosis or treatment of other eye conditions (e.g., diabetic retinopathy).
- No absolute visual acuity threshold; patient-centered decision-making.

### Preoperative Evaluation
- Comprehensive eye examination including visual acuity, refraction, IOP, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, dilated fundoscopy.
- **Biometry**: Accurate axial length and keratometry measurements for intraocular lens (IOL) power calculation.
- Assess for ocular surface disease (dry eye, blepharitis) and treat before surgery.
- Screen for glaucoma, macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy.

### IOL Selection
- **Monofocal IOL**: Standard; typically targets distance vision; patient may need reading glasses.
- **Multifocal / Extended Depth of Focus (EDOF) IOL**: May reduce spectacle dependence; discuss halos, glare risks.
- **Toric IOL**: For patients with significant corneal astigmatism.

### Surgical Technique
- **Phacoemulsification**: Standard of care.
- **Femtosecond Laser-Assisted Cataract Surgery (FLACS)**: Available option; no proven superiority over conventional phacoemulsification for most patients.

### Postoperative Care
- Topical antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drops.
- Routine follow-up at day 1, week 1-2, and 1 month.
- Monitor for complications: infection (endophthalmitis), cystoid macular edema, IOL dislocation, posterior capsule opacification.

### Outcomes
- Cataract surgery has a high success rate (>95% achieve improved vision).
