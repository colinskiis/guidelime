## Scope

This Preferred Practice Pattern provides recommendations for the diagnosis and management of primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG).

## Key Recommendations

### Diagnosis
- Comprehensive eye examination
- IOP measurement (Goldmann applanation)
- Gonioscopy to confirm open angle
- Optic nerve assessment (cup-to-disc ratio, RNFL)
- Visual field testing (standard automated perimetry)
- OCT of RNFL and optic nerve head

### Risk Factors
- Elevated IOP (major modifiable risk factor)
- Family history of glaucoma
- Age >40 years
- African American ancestry
- Thin central corneal thickness
- Myopia

### Target IOP
- Individualized based on severity and progression risk
- Consider 20-30% reduction from baseline initially
- Lower targets for advanced disease or rapid progression

### Medical Therapy
**First-Line:**
- Prostaglandin analogs (latanoprost, bimatoprost, travoprost, latanoprostene bunod, tafluprost)

**Second-Line/Adjunctive:**
- Beta-blockers (timolol, betaxolol)
- Alpha-2 agonists (brimonidine)
- Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (dorzolamide, brinzolamide, oral acetazolamide)
- Rho kinase inhibitors (netarsudil)
- Fixed-combination products

### Laser Therapy
- SLT (selective laser trabeculoplasty): First-line or adjunct
- Can repeat SLT if prior response
- ALT (argon laser trabeculoplasty) alternative

### Surgical Therapy (Progressive Disease)
**Traditional:**
- Trabeculectomy
- Glaucoma drainage device (tube shunt)

**MIGS (Minimally Invasive Glaucoma Surgery):**
- iStent, Hydrus, XEN gel stent, Kahook goniotomy
- Often combined with cataract surgery
- Moderate IOP reduction

### Monitoring
- IOP, visual field, optic nerve/OCT assessment periodically
- Frequency based on severity and stability
- Lifelong monitoring required
