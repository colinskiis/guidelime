## Scope
Evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis and management of primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) in adults.

## Key Recommendations

### Diagnosis

#### Definition of POAG
- Open anterior chamber angle
- Characteristic optic nerve damage
- Associated visual field loss
- No identifiable secondary cause

#### Initial Evaluation
| Assessment | Details |
|------------|---------|
| History | Family history, ocular history, medications |
| IOP measurement | Goldmann applanation preferred |
| Gonioscopy | Document angle grade and structures |
| Optic nerve evaluation | Cup-to-disc ratio, rim assessment, hemorrhages |
| Visual field testing | Standard automated perimetry |
| Central corneal thickness | Affects IOP interpretation |

#### Optic Nerve Imaging
- OCT of RNFL and optic nerve head
- Serial imaging to detect progression
- Baseline and follow-up comparison

### IOP Target
- No universal target; individualized approach
- Consider: Baseline IOP, disease severity, life expectancy
- Generally aim for 20-50% reduction from baseline
- Lower targets for advanced disease

### Medical Therapy

#### First-Line Agents
| Drug Class | Examples | Mechanism |
|------------|----------|-----------|
| Prostaglandin analogs | Latanoprost, bimatoprost, travoprost | Increase uveoscleral outflow |
| Beta-blockers | Timolol, betaxolol | Decrease aqueous production |
| Alpha agonists | Brimonidine | Decrease production, increase outflow |

#### Second-Line Agents
| Drug Class | Examples |
|------------|----------|
| Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors | Dorzolamide, brinzolamide |
| Rho kinase inhibitors | Netarsudil |
| Combination products | Fixed combinations |

#### Principles of Medical Therapy
- Start with monotherapy
- Assess efficacy at 4-6 weeks
- Add or switch if target IOP not achieved
- Consider adherence before adding medications
- Re-evaluate periodically

### Laser Therapy

#### Selective Laser Trabeculoplasty (SLT)
- May be used as initial therapy
- Repeatable
- 20-30% IOP reduction expected
- Effect may wane over 2-5 years

#### Argon Laser Trabeculoplasty (ALT)
- Less commonly used now
- Limited repeatability

### Surgical Options

#### Trabeculectomy
- Creates fistula for aqueous drainage
- Antimetabolites (MMC, 5-FU) improve success
- Risk: Hypotony, infection, bleb-related complications

#### Glaucoma Drainage Devices
- Tube shunts (Ahmed, Baerveldt)
- For refractory cases or high-risk eyes
- Consider in uveitic or neovascular glaucoma

#### Minimally Invasive Glaucoma Surgery (MIGS)
- iStent, Hydrus, goniotomy, canaloplasty
- Lower IOP reduction than traditional surgery
- Favorable safety profile
- Often combined with cataract surgery

### Monitoring

#### Frequency of Follow-up
| Disease Stage | Stable | Progressing |
|---------------|--------|-------------|
| Early | Every 6-12 months | Every 3-6 months |
| Moderate | Every 4-6 months | Every 3-4 months |
| Advanced | Every 3-4 months | Every 1-3 months |

#### Progression Assessment
- Serial visual fields (at least annually)
- OCT imaging
- Optic nerve photos
- IOP trends

### Patient Education
- Chronic, lifelong disease
- Importance of medication adherence
- Regular follow-up essential
- Family members should be screened
