## Scope

This Preferred Practice Pattern provides recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), including dry and neovascular (wet) forms.

## Key Recommendations

### Risk Factors
- Age (major risk factor)
- Smoking (modifiable)
- Family history
- Genetic variants (CFH, ARMS2)
- Caucasian race

### Classification
**Dry AMD:**
- Early: Medium drusen
- Intermediate: Large drusen, pigmentary changes
- Late (Geographic Atrophy): Atrophic macular lesions

**Wet (Neovascular) AMD:**
- Choroidal neovascularization (CNV)
- Subretinal and intraretinal fluid
- Hemorrhage or scarring

### Diagnostic Tests
- Dilated fundus examination
- OCT (essential for diagnosis and monitoring)
- Fluorescein angiography for CNV confirmation
- OCT angiography (OCTA) as adjunct
- Amsler grid for home monitoring

### Treatment: Dry AMD (Intermediate)
- AREDS2 supplementation (vitamins C, E, zinc, lutein, zeaxanthin)
- No treatment for early AMD
- Smoking cessation

### Treatment: Geographic Atrophy
- Pegcetacoplan (complement C3 inhibitor) FDA approved
- Avacincaptad pegol (complement C5 inhibitor) FDA approved
- Reduce GA progression but do not restore vision

### Treatment: Neovascular AMD
**Anti-VEGF Therapy (First-Line):**
- Aflibercept
- Ranibizumab
- Brolucizumab
- Faricimab (bispecific anti-VEGF/Ang-2)

**Dosing Regimens:**
- Monthly or treat-and-extend protocols
- Pro re nata (PRN) approach alternative
- Long-interval dosing for durable agents

### Monitoring
- OCT at each treatment visit
- Prompt re-treatment for fluid recurrence
- Lifelong monitoring required
