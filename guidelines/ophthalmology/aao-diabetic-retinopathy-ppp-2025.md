## Scope
Updated comprehensive standards for the screening, diagnosis, and evidence-based management of diabetic retinopathy (DR) and diabetic macular edema (DME).

## Key Recommendations

### Screening and Examination
- **Type 1 Diabetes**: Initial screening within 5 years of diagnosis and annually thereafter.
- **Type 2 Diabetes**: Initial screening at the time of diagnosis and annually thereafter.
- **Pregnancy**: Patients with preexisting diabetes should have an eye exam early in the first trimester and follow-up every 1-3 months based on severity of DR.

### Diagnosis and Monitoring
- **Dilated Fundus Exam**: The clinical standard for documenting DR severity.
- **Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT)**: Preferred for the detection and monitoring of center-involved diabetic macular edema (CI-DME).
- **Ultrawide-field (UWF) Imaging**: May be considered for more accurate staging as it captures peripheral lesions not seen on standard 7-field photography.

### Management: Diabetic Macular Edema (DME)
- **Anti-VEGF Therapy**: Strong recommendation as first-line therapy for CI-DME with vision loss (e.g., Aflibercept, Ranibizumab, Bevacizumab). 
- **Biosimilars**: Recognizes the use of FDA-approved anti-VEGF biosimilars as safe and effective options.
- **Focal Laser**: May be considered for non-center-involved DME or as adjunct therapy in specific cases.

### Management: Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (PDR)
- **Panretinal Photocoagulation (PRP)**: Remains the standard of care for achieving long-term stabilization and regression of neovascularization.
- **Anti-VEGF for PDR**: Can be considered as an alternative to PRP in patients with high compliance and those requiring CI-DME treatment.

### Systemic Control
- **Multidisciplinary Approach**: Emphasizes the critical role of glycemic control (target HbA1c ~7.0%) and blood pressure control in slowing the progression of DR.
- **Lipid Management**: Control of serum lipids may help reduce the risk of macular exudates and clinical vision loss.

### Education
- Patients should be educated about the often asymptomatic nature of early DR and the importance of regular follow-up to prevent irreversible vision loss.
