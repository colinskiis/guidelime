# IWGDF/IDSA Guidelines on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Diabetes-Related Foot Infections

## Scope
Evidence-based recommendations for diagnosis and treatment of diabetes-related foot infections (DFI), including soft tissue infections and osteomyelitis.

## Key Recommendations

### Classification of Infection Severity

| Grade | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Uninfected | No signs of infection |
| Mild | Local infection involving skin/subcutaneous tissue; erythema >0.5 cm but ≤2 cm |
| Moderate | Local infection with erythema >2 cm OR deeper tissue involvement |
| Severe | Local infection with systemic inflammatory response (SIRS) or metabolic instability |

### Diagnosis

#### Clinical Assessment
- Diagnosis is primarily clinical based on signs of inflammation
- At least 2 signs: erythema, warmth, tenderness, swelling, purulent discharge
- Probe-to-bone test for suspected osteomyelitis

#### Laboratory Studies
- ESR and CRP useful for monitoring treatment response
- Procalcitonin may help distinguish soft tissue vs bone infection

#### Imaging for Osteomyelitis
- **Plain X-ray**: First-line (may be normal early)
- **MRI**: Gold standard when diagnosis unclear
- Consider bone biopsy for culture if diagnosis uncertain or treatment failure

### Microbiological Sampling

#### When to Culture
- Moderate to severe infections
- Failed initial therapy
- Before antibiotic changes

#### How to Obtain Specimens
- Cleanse and debride wound first
- Curettage or tissue biopsy preferred over swabs
- Bone biopsy for osteomyelitis (if feasible)

### Antibiotic Treatment

#### Mild Infections (Oral Therapy)
- Duration: **1-2 weeks**
- Target Gram-positive cocci (S. aureus, streptococci)
- Options: Dicloxacillin, cephalexin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, clindamycin
- If MRSA risk: TMP-SMX, doxycycline

#### Moderate Infections
- Duration: **2-3 weeks**
- Oral or IV depending on severity
- Broader coverage including Gram-negatives
- Options: Amoxicillin-clavulanate, fluoroquinolone ± clindamycin, piperacillin-tazobactam

#### Severe Infections
- Duration: **2-4 weeks** (soft tissue)
- IV therapy initially
- Broad-spectrum: Piperacillin-tazobactam, carbapenem, or combination therapy
- Add vancomycin or linezolid if MRSA suspected

### Osteomyelitis Treatment

#### Duration
- **≤3 weeks** after minor amputation with positive bone margin culture
- **6 weeks** if no bone resection or amputation

#### Surgical vs Medical
- Consider antibiotic-only therapy if:
  - Forefoot location
  - No PAD (peripheral arterial disease)
  - No exposed bone
  - No immediate need for debridement
- Surgery preferred if:
  - Severe infection
  - PAD present
  - Failed medical therapy
  - Large sequestrum

#### Follow-Up
- Monitor for clinical improvement
- Repeat inflammatory markers
- Remission defined at ≥6 months after completing antibiotics

### Surgical Considerations
- Urgent surgical consultation for:
  - Deep abscess
  - Necrotizing fasciitis
  - Gas in tissues
  - Severe ischemia with infection
- Vascular assessment essential before major surgery

### Prevention
- Optimize glycemic control
- Regular foot examinations
- Patient education on foot care
- Treat non-infected ulcers promptly
