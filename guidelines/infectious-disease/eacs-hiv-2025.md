## Scope
Version 13.0 (2025) of the comprehensive EACS guidelines, providing clinical standards for the treatment of HIV-positive adults, including antiretroviral therapy (ART), prevention, and management of comorbidities and co-infections.

## Key Recommendations

### Initiation of ART
- **"Treat All"**: Reaffirms that ART should be recommended for all individuals with HIV, regardless of CD4 cell count, to reduce morbidity, mortality, and prevent transmission (U=U).
- **Rapid Start**: Recommends starting ART as soon as possible after diagnosis, ideally on the same day if the patient is ready.

### Preferred ART Regimens
- **Integrase Inhibitors (INSTIs)**: INSTI-based regimens (e.g., bictegravir, dolutegravir) remain the preferred first-line choice due to high efficacy and high genetic barrier to resistance.
- **2-Drug Regimens**: Supports the use of dolutegravir/lamivudine as a first-line option for patients without baseline resistance and HBV co-infection.

### Care of the Aging Population
- **Comorbidity Screening**: New emphasis on proactive screening and management of geriatric syndromes (frailty, cognitive decline, polypharmacy) in people living with HIV aged 50 and older.
- **Polypharmacy**: Meticulous review of drug-drug interactions (DDIs) using the University of Liverpool DDI tool.

### Metabolic and Cardiovascular Health
- **Lipid Management**: Aggressive management of dyslipidemia to reduce cardiovascular risk, recognizing that HIV is an independent risk factor.
- **Weight Gain**: Monitoring for metabolic changes and weight gain associated with some newer ART agents (e.g., TAF and certain INSTIs).

### Viral Hepatitis Co-infection
- **HCV**: Universal screening and treatment with direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) for all HIV/HCV co-infected individuals.
- **HBV**: Ensure ART regimens include tenofovir (TDF or TAF) to provide dual activity against HIV and HBV.

### Prevention
- **PrEP**: Recommends widespread access to Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis for individuals at high risk of HIV acquisition, including oral and long-acting injectable options.
