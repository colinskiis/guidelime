## Scope

This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (cystitis and pyelonephritis) in otherwise healthy adult women.

## Key Recommendations

### Acute Uncomplicated Cystitis
- First-line: Nitrofurantoin 100mg BID x 5 days
- First-line: TMP-SMX 160/800mg BID x 3 days (if resistance <20%)
- First-line: Fosfomycin 3g single dose
- Alternative: Pivmecillinam (where available)
- Avoid: Fluoroquinolones for uncomplicated cystitis

### Acute Uncomplicated Pyelonephritis
- Outpatient (mild-moderate): 
  - Ciprofloxacin 500mg BID x 7 days
  - Levofloxacin 750mg daily x 5-7 days
  - TMP-SMX 160/800mg BID x 14 days (if susceptible)
- Inpatient (severe): IV ceftriaxone or fluoroquinolone

### Recurrent UTI Prevention
- Behavioral modifications: Voiding habits, hydration
- Vaginal estrogen for postmenopausal women
- Antibiotic prophylaxis: Low-dose continuous or post-coital
- D-mannose: Insufficient evidence for routine use
- Cranberry: May reduce symptomatic recurrences

### Diagnosis
- Urinalysis with culture for pyelonephritis
- Cystitis: Empiric treatment without culture acceptable
- Imaging: Not routine; consider for complicated cases

### Antibiotic Stewardship
- Local antibiogram guidance for empiric therapy
- Duration: Shortest effective course
- Asymptomatic bacteriuria: Treat only in pregnancy
