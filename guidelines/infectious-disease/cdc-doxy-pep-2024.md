## Scope
Clinical guidelines for the use of 200 mg of doxycycline as post-exposure prophylaxis (Doxy-PEP) to reduce the incidence of syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women (TGW) at increased risk for these infections.

## Key Recommendations

### Target Population
- **Recommended**: MSM and TGW who have had at least one bacterial STI (syphilis, chlamydia, or gonorrhea) in the past 12 months.
- **Shared Decision-Making**: May be discussed with MSM and TGW who engage in activities that increase likelihood of STI exposure, even without a recent STI.

### Dosage and Administration
- **Regimen**: 200 mg of doxycycline.
- **Timing**: Taken as soon as possible, and **within 72 hours** after oral, vaginal, or anal sex.
- **Maximum Dose**: 200 mg every 24 hours.

### Effectiveness
In prospective clinical trials, Doxy-PEP has shown:
- **Syphilis**: ~70-80% reduction.
- **Chlamydia**: ~70-90% reduction.
- **Gonorrhea**: ~50% reduction.

### Clinical Management and Monitoring
- **Baseline Testing**: Conduct bacterial STI and HIV screening before or at the time of Doxy-PEP initiation.
- **Follow-up**: Assess ongoing need every **3-6 months**.
- **Screening Frequency**: Conduct STI screening (including extra-genital sites) and HIV testing every 3-6 months.
- **Counseling**: Discuss side effects, the importance of adherence, and that Doxy-PEP does not protect against HIV or other STIs (e.g., mpox, hepatitis).

### Comprehensive Sexual Health context
Doxy-PEP should be part of a comprehensive strategy that includes:
- Condom use and risk reduction counseling.
- Linkage to HIV PrEP or HIV care.
- Recommended vaccinations (Hepatitis A/B, HPV, mpox).
- Prompt treatment for any diagnosed STIs and partner notification.

### Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR)
- Providers should monitor for potential antimicrobial resistance, although current data suggests the benefit of infection reduction outweighs the current risk of AMR in the target population.
- CDC continues to monitor national AMR trends for N. gonorrhoeae and S. aureus.
