## Scope

This guideline provides consolidated recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis (TB), including drug-susceptible and drug-resistant forms, for use in national TB programs and clinical practice.

## Key Recommendations

### Diagnosis
- Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra as initial diagnostic test
- LF-LAM for TB in people living with HIV
- Next-generation sequencing for comprehensive drug-resistance testing
- Culture and DST for rifampicin-resistant cases

### Drug-Susceptible TB Treatment
- Standard 6-month regimen: 2HRZE/4HR
- 4-month regimen: Consider for non-cavitary, smear-negative pulmonary TB
- Fixed-dose combinations recommended
- DOT or video-observed therapy (VOT) options

### Drug-Resistant TB Treatment
- MDR/RR-TB: All-oral regimens preferred
- BPaL/BPaLM regimen (bedaquiline, pretomanid, linezolid +/- moxifloxacin)
- Treatment duration: 6-9 months for BPaL-based regimens
- Individualized regimens for complex resistance patterns

### Pre-XDR and XDR-TB
- BPaL-based regimens with additional agents
- All available effective drugs included
- Duration: Up to 18-24 months for complex cases

### Latent TB Infection (LTBI)
- 3HP (isoniazid + rifapentine weekly x 12 weeks)
- 1HP (daily x 4 weeks) for high-risk groups
- 3-4 months rifampicin alternative to 6-9 months isoniazid

### Special Populations
- HIV co-infection: ART initiation; drug interactions
- Pregnancy: Standard regimens with pyridoxine
- Children: Weight-based dosing; child-friendly formulations
