## Scope
Updated evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis, treatment, and long-term follow-up of children and adults with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection.

## Key Recommendations

### Indications for Treatment
- **Threshold**: Treatment is recommended for all patients with:
  - HBeAg-positive or HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B (HBV DNA >2,000 IU/mL, elevated ALT, and/or at least moderate liver necroinflammation or fibrosis).
  - Compensated or decompensated cirrhosis, regardless of HBV DNA level.
  - HBV DNA >20,000 IU/mL and ALT >2x ULN, regardless of the degree of fibrosis.

### Preferred Antiviral Therapy
- **Nucleos(t)ide Analogues (NAs)**: Long-term therapy with high genetic barrier to resistance is preferred:
  - **Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF)**
  - **Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)**
  - **Entecavir (ETV)**
- **Safety**: TAF or ETV are preferred for patients with or at risk of bone or renal disease.

### Monitoring and Response
- **Goal**: Long-term suppression of HBV DNA to undetectable levels.
- **HBsAg Loss**: Functional cure (HBsAg loss with or without anti-HBs seroconversion) remains the "ideal" endpoint, though it is infrequently achieved with current NAs.

### Management of Special Populations
- **Pregnancy**: TDF is recommended starting at 24-28 weeks of gestation for pregnant individuals with high HBV DNA (>200,000 IU/mL) to prevent mother-to-child transmission.
- **Coinfection**: All HIV/HBV coinfected patients should receive an ART regimen containing TDF or TAF.

### HCC Screening
- **Requirement**: Mandatory 6-monthly ultrasound (with or without AFP) for all patients with cirrhosis or those at high risk (e.g., family history of HCC, older age).
