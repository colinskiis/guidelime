# IDSA 2025 Guideline on the Treatment and Management of COVID-19

## Scope

Updated comprehensive recommendations for the treatment and management of COVID-19 in both outpatient and inpatient settings, including therapeutics for varying disease severity.

## Key Recommendations

### Outpatient Management (Mild-to-Moderate)
- **Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (Paxlovid)**: Still recommended for patients at high risk of progression (within 5 days).
- **Remdesivir**: Recommended for high-risk outpatients if nirmatrelvir-ritonavir is not feasible.
- **Molnupiravir**: Suggested only if other preferred therapies are not available.

### Inpatient Management (Severe/Critical)
- **Corticosteroids**: Dexamethasone recommended for patients requiring supplemental oxygen or mechanical ventilation.
- **IL-6 Inhibitors (Tocilizumab/Sarilumab)**: Recommended for patients with rapid respiratory decline.
- **JAK Inhibitors (Baricitinib)**: Recommended for hospitalized patients requiring supplemental oxygen.
- **Vilobelimab**: Specifically addressed for critically ill patients (focused update Feb 2025).

### Pre-exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP)
- **Pemivibart**: Updated recommendations for immunocompromised patients at high risk (update Aug 2024).

## Notes

The IDSA COVID-19 guidelines are "living guidelines" and are updated as new clinical trial data and viral variants emerge.
