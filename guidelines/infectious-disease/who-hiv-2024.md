## Scope

This guideline provides consolidated recommendations for HIV prevention, testing, treatment, service delivery, and monitoring across all populations.

## Key Recommendations

### HIV Testing
- HIV testing services for all
- Index testing and partner notification
- HIV self-testing as additional option
- Repeat testing for high-risk populations

### Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP)
- Oral PrEP: TDF/FTC or TDF/3TC daily
- Event-driven (2-1-1) PrEP for MSM
- Long-acting injectable cabotegravir (CAB-LA) every 2 months
- Dapivirine vaginal ring for women

### Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP)
- Initiate within 72 hours of exposure
- 28-day course: TDF + 3TC (or FTC) + DTG
- Follow-up HIV testing at 4-6 weeks

### Antiretroviral Therapy (ART)
**Initiation:**
- Rapid ART initiation (same-day if possible)
- Treat all people living with HIV regardless of CD4

**First-Line Adults:**
- DTG + TDF + 3TC (or FTC) preferred
- DTG-based regimens preferred over efavirenz
- TAF can replace TDF for renal/bone concerns

**Second-Line:**
- DTG-based if not in first-line
- PI-based (DRV/r or ATV/r) + 2 NRTIs

**Third-Line/Drug Resistance:**
- Genotypic resistance testing when available
- DRV/r + DTG + optimized backbone

### Treatment Monitoring
- Viral load preferred for monitoring
- Target: Viral suppression <1000 copies/mL (WHO) or <50 (standard)
- CD4 at baseline; less frequent if virally suppressed

### Special Populations
- Pregnancy: DTG safe throughout pregnancy
- Children: Age-appropriate formulations
- TB co-infection: Adjust ART timing and drug interactions
