## Scope

Evidence-based guideline for diagnosis and treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in immunocompetent adults, including empiric antibiotic selection, severity assessment, and duration of therapy.

## Notes

Major update after 12 years. Key recommendations:
- Recommends against routine sputum Gram stain/culture in outpatients
- Standard empiric therapy for outpatients: amoxicillin OR doxycycline OR macrolide (if local resistance <25%)
- For inpatients: beta-lactam + macrolide OR respiratory fluoroquinolone
- 5-day antibiotic duration is adequate for most patients with CAP
- Procalcitonin should not be used to determine need for antibiotics initially
