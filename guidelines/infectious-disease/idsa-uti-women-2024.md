## Scope
2024 IDSA guideline update on the diagnosis and treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis and pyelonephritis in women.

## Key Recommendations

### Diagnosis of Acute Cystitis
- **Clinical Diagnosis**: Dysuria, frequency, urgency, suprapubic pain, absence of vaginal symptoms.
- **Urinalysis/Urine Dip**: Pyuria, positive leukocyte esterase, nitrites (specific but not sensitive).
- **Urine Culture**: Not required for uncomplicated cystitis unless recurrent or treatment failure expected.

### First-Line Antibiotics for Acute Uncomplicated Cystitis
- **Nitrofurantoin Monohydrate/Macrocrystals**: 100 mg BID x 5 days. Preferred.
- **Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX)**: 160/800 mg BID x 3 days. Use if local resistance <20%.
- **Fosfomycin**: 3 g single dose. Slightly less effective but convenient.

### Second-Line / Alternatives
- **Beta-Lactams (Amoxicillin-Clavulanate, Cefdinir, Cefpodoxime)**: Less effective than first-line options; reserve for cases where first-line agents are not suitable.
- **Fluoroquinolones (Ciprofloxacin, Levofloxacin)**: Avoid for uncomplicated cystitis due to resistance concerns and FDA black box warnings; reserve for complicated infections.

### Acute Uncomplicated Pyelonephritis
- **Outpatient Management**: Oral fluoroquinolone (ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin) x 5-7 days OR TMP-SMX x 14 days (if susceptibility confirmed).
- **Inpatient Management**: IV antibiotics (ceftriaxone, fluoroquinolone, aminoglycoside ± ampicillin) with transition to oral based on culture.
- Urine culture is recommended for pyelonephritis.

### Recurrent UTI
- Covered in separate guidelines; may consider post-coital prophylaxis, continuous prophylaxis, or patient-initiated therapy.

### Asymptomatic Bacteriuria
- Do NOT treat except in pregnant women or pre-urologic procedure.
