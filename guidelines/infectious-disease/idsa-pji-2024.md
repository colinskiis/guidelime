## Scope
2024 IDSA guideline update on the diagnosis and management of prosthetic joint infection (PJI).

## Key Recommendations

### Diagnosis
- **Clinical Suspicion**: Persistent joint pain, wound drainage, sinus tract, fever.
- **Synovial Fluid Analysis**: Aspiration before antibiotics when feasible.
  - Cell count (WBC >3,000 cells/μL, >80% PMN suggestive).
  - Culture (most important; hold for 14 days).
  - Alpha-defensin, synovial CRP.
- **Serum Markers**: ESR, CRP (elevated but non-specific).
- **Intraoperative Tissue Cultures**: Multiple (≥3) periprosthetic tissue samples; hold 14 days.
- **Imaging**: X-ray (loosening, osteolysis); nuclear medicine (WBC scan) if diagnosis unclear.

### Treatment Options

#### DAIR (Debridement, Antibiotics, and Implant Retention)
- For acute PJI (<4 weeks post-op or <3 weeks of symptoms) with stable implant and susceptible organism.
- Exchange modular components (polyethylene liner, femoral head).
- IV antibiotics followed by oral rifampin-based regimen for staphylococci.

#### Two-Stage Exchange (Preferred for Chronic PJI)
- Remove all prosthetic components.
- Place antibiotic-impregnated cement spacer.
- IV antibiotics (typically 4-6 weeks).
- Reimplant new prosthesis after infection controlled and markers normalized.

#### One-Stage Exchange
- May be considered at experienced centers for select patients with adequate soft tissue and known susceptible organism.

### Antibiotic Therapy
- **Staphylococcal PJI**: Rifampin-based combination (e.g., rifampin + fluoroquinolone or rifampin + TMP-SMX) after initial IV phase.
- **Duration**: Typically 6 weeks IV ± extended oral suppression if implant retained.

### Chronic Suppression
- Long-term oral antibiotic suppression may be considered for patients who cannot undergo surgery or have residual infection.
