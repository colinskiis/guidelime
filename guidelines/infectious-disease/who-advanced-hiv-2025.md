## Scope
Updated evidence-based recommendations for the package of care for people with advanced HIV disease (AHD), defined as those with a CD4 cell count <200 cells/mm³ or WHO clinical stage 3 or 4.

## Key Recommendations

### Definition and Screening
- **Definition**: Remains CD4 count <200 cells/mm³ or clinical stage 3/4.
- **CD4 Testing**: Urgent CD4 testing is required for all patients presenting or re-engaging with care to identify AHD.

### Package of Care (The "AHD Package")
- **Screening for Opportunistic Infections (OIs)**:
  - **Tuberculosis**: Xpert MTB/RIF as the first-line diagnostic. LF-LAM for those with AHD or who are seriously ill.
  - **Cryptococcus**: Serum/plasma/blood CrAg screening for all adults with CD4 <200.

- **Prophylaxis**:
  - **Cotrimoxazole**: For all with AHD.
  - **TB Preventive Treatment (TPT)**: For all those without active TB.
  - **Fluconazole**: Pre-emptive therapy for those who are CrAg positive without meningitis.

### ART Initiation
- **Timing**: 
  - Rapid ART initiation (within 7 days) for those with AHD and no OIs.
  - Delay ART if TB meningitis or Cryptococcal meningitis is suspected/confirmed.
- **Regimen**: Dolutegravir (DTG)-based regimens are preferred first-line.

### Managing Treatment Failure and Re-engagement
- **Re-engagement with Care**: AHD package should be offered to all those returning to care after an interruption.
- **Switching**: Guidance on when to switch to second-line or third-line regimens.

### Pediatric Considerations
- **AHD in Children**: All children <5 years are considered to have AHD.
- **Screening and Prophylaxis**: Specific dosing and diagnostic tools for pediatric populations.

### Service Delivery
- **Decentralization**: Encourages AHD care at the primary health care level where feasible.
- **Point-of-Care Testing**: Prioritize POC CD4 and CrAg tests to reduce turnaround time.
