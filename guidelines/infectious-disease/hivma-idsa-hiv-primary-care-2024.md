## Scope
Comprehensive evidence-based guidance for primary care of persons living with HIV, including prevention, screening, and management of comorbidities.

## Key Recommendations

### General Principles
- Patient-centered, stigma-free care environment
- Multidisciplinary team approach
- Address barriers to care at all levels
- Use telehealth and street medicine as appropriate

### Antiretroviral Therapy

#### Goals
- Achieve and maintain viral suppression (<200 copies/mL)
- Undetectable = Untransmittable (U=U)
- Optimize immune function

#### Monitoring
| Test | Frequency |
|------|-----------|
| HIV viral load | At initiation, then every 3-6 months |
| CD4 count | At initiation; may discontinue if stable |
| Drug resistance | Before starting/changing ART |

### Immunizations

#### Recommended Vaccines
| Vaccine | Recommendations |
|---------|-----------------|
| Influenza | Annual |
| COVID-19 | Per current CDC guidance |
| Pneumococcal | PCV20 or PCV15 + PPSV23 |
| Hepatitis A | If non-immune |
| Hepatitis B | If non-immune; check titers |
| HPV | Through age 45 |
| Tdap/Td | Standard schedule |
| Zoster (Shingrix) | Age ≥50 (consider ≥18 if CD4 <200) |
| Mpox | Per risk factors |

#### Live Vaccines
- Generally avoid if CD4 <200
- MMR may be given if CD4 ≥200
- Varicella: Consider if CD4 ≥200 and non-immune

### Cancer Screening

#### Cervical Cancer
- Annual cytology if HIV-positive
- Co-testing (cytology + HPV) every 3 years if CD4 ≥200 and normal results
- Treat precancerous lesions per ASCCP guidelines

#### Anal Cancer
- Digital anorectal exam annually for all
- Consider anal cytology for MSM, women with cervical dysplasia
- High-resolution anoscopy for abnormal cytology

#### Other Cancers
- Breast, colon, lung: Follow general population guidelines
- May have earlier onset; individualize screening

### Sexually Transmitted Infections

#### Screening Recommendations
| STI | Frequency |
|-----|-----------|
| Syphilis | At least annually; more frequent if high risk |
| Gonorrhea/Chlamydia | At least annually; test all sites of exposure |
| Hepatitis C | Annually if ongoing risk |
| Trichomonas | Annually for women |

#### Mpox
- Vaccination for those at risk
- Treatment: Tecovirimat if needed

#### Doxycycline PEP (DoxyPEP)
- May be offered to MSM and transgender women with recent STI
- 200 mg doxycycline within 72 hours of condomless sex
- Reduces risk of syphilis, chlamydia, possibly gonorrhea

### Metabolic and Cardiovascular Health

#### Cardiovascular Risk
- Higher CV risk in people with HIV
- Aggressive risk factor management
- ASCVD risk assessment

#### Statin Therapy
- Consider for primary prevention
- Drug interactions with some ART (check interactions)
- Pitavastatin preferred (minimal interactions)

#### Diabetes Screening
- Screen with fasting glucose or HbA1c annually
- Some ART may affect glucose metabolism

#### Lipid Management
- Screen annually
- Treat per ASCVD guidelines
- Monitor for drug interactions

### Bone Health
- Increased risk of osteoporosis
- DEXA screening per general guidelines (earlier if risk factors)
- Vitamin D supplementation as needed
- Tenofovir disoproxil may affect bone density

### Kidney and Liver Health

#### Kidney Monitoring
- Urinalysis and eGFR at baseline and annually
- More frequent if on tenofovir DF
- Tenofovir alafenamide has less nephrotoxicity

#### Liver Health
- Screen for hepatitis A, B, C
- Immunize for A and B if non-immune
- Treat hepatitis C (curative DAA therapy available)
- Liver enzymes at baseline and as indicated

### Mental Health
- Screen for depression, anxiety
- Address substance use disorders
- Integrate mental health services
- Trauma-informed care

### Special Populations

#### Adolescents
- Age-appropriate education
- Transition planning to adult care
- Contraception counseling

#### Pregnancy
- ART throughout pregnancy
- Viral suppression prevents transmission
- Avoid breastfeeding in resource-rich settings

#### Transgender and Gender-Diverse Persons
- Affirming care
- Monitor hormone therapy interactions with ART
- Address specific health needs

#### Older Adults
- Polypharmacy concerns
- Geriatric syndromes
- Frailty assessment

### Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP)
- For HIV-negative partners of people with HIV
- Multiple options (oral daily, injectable CAB-LA)
- Ensure partners have access

### Documentation and Quality
- Regular assessment of viral suppression rates
- Retention in care metrics
- Patient-reported outcomes
