## Scope
First IDSA guideline dedicated specifically to the classification, diagnosis, and management of complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI) in adults, including pyelonephritis in patients with structural or functional abnormalities.

## Key Recommendations

### Definition and Classification
- **cUTI Definition**: Infections occurring in individuals with structural or functional abnormalities of the urinary tract (e.g., indwelling catheters, neurogenic bladder, stones, or prior instrumentation).
- **Distinction**: Clearly distinguishes cUTI from uncomplicated cystitis to guide more intensive evaluation and longer treatment durations when necessary.

### Diagnostic Evaluation
- **Urine Culture**: Mandatory for all patients with suspected cUTI to guide pathogen-specific therapy.
- **Imaging**: Recommends prompt renal tract imaging (e.g., US or CT) if the patient remains febrile or symptomatic after 48-72 hours of appropriate antibiotic therapy to rule out obstruction or abscess.

### Empiric Therapy
- **Risk Assessment**: Choice of empiric therapy should be based on local resistance data and the patient's individual risk factors for multi-drug resistant (MDR) organisms (e.g., prior ESBL, recent hospitalization).
- **ESBL Risk**: For patients at high risk for ESBL-producing Enterobacterales, a carbapenem or newer beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor (e.g., ceftazidime-avibactam) may be indicated.
- **Pseudomonas Risk**: Ensure empiric coverage includes antipseudomonal agents if risk factors are present.

### Directed Therapy and Duration
- **De-escalation**: Strongly recommends narrowing therapy based on culture results as soon as possible.
- **Duration**: 
  - For most cUTIs with rapid clinical response: 7 days.
  - For pyelonephritis or cases with delayed response: 10-14 days.
  - Long-term suppressive therapy is generally discouraged unless specifically indicated for recurrent, non-remediable structural issues.

### Catheter-Associated UTI (CAUTI)
- **Management**: Recommends removal or replacement of the indwelling catheter if it has been in place for >2 weeks and remains necessary.
- **Screening**: Discourages screening for or treating asymptomatic bacteriuria in catheterized patients.
