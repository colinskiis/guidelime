# IDSA 2025 Guideline for Complicated Urinary Tract Infections

## Scope

Provides evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis and management of complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI), including pyelonephritis and infections associated with anatomical or functional abnormalities.

## Key Recommendations

### Definitions
- Expands cUTI definition to include both male and female patients with risks for treatment failure or serious complications.
- Emphasizes the role of infection site and systemic involvement over simple anatomical definitions.

### Diagnosis
- Urine culture and susceptibility testing are required for all cases of cUTI.
- Imaging (CT/US) recommended for patients with persistent symptoms or suspected obstruction/abscess.

### Treatment
- Choice of agent should be guided by local antibiogram and patient-specific risk factors for MDR pathogens.
- For stable patients, oral therapy (e.g., fluoroquinolones, TMP-SMX) is preferred if susceptibility is confirmed.
- Duration of therapy: Generally 7-10 days for pyelonephritis and cUTI, depending on clinical response.

## Notes

This is a major new guideline specifically addressing the complex management of UTIs beyond simple cystitis.
