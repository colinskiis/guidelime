## Scope
2024 IDSA guideline update on the diagnosis and management of invasive candidiasis and candidemia in adults.

## Key Recommendations

### Diagnosis
- Blood cultures remain standard; draw from peripheral and central lines.
- β-D-glucan and T2Candida panel may support diagnosis in culture-negative cases.
- Speciation and antifungal susceptibility testing are essential.

### Initial Therapy (Candidemia)

#### Echinocandins (First-Line)
- **Caspofungin** (70 mg load, then 50 mg/day), **Micafungin** (100 mg/day), or **Anidulafungin** (200 mg load, then 100 mg/day).
- Preferred for most patients, especially critically ill, prior azole exposure, or unknown species.

#### Fluconazole
- May be used in non-critically ill patients with susceptible Candida (C. albicans, C. parapsilosis) and no prior azole exposure.
- Dose: 800 mg load, then 400 mg/day (adjust for renal function).

#### Step-Down to Fluconazole
- After clinical improvement and susceptibility confirmed, transition to oral fluconazole to complete course.

### Duration
- **Candidemia Without Metastatic Complications**: Minimum 14 days from first negative blood culture and resolution of signs/symptoms.
- **Deep-Seated Infections (Endocarditis, Osteomyelitis)**: Prolonged therapy, often weeks to months.

### Source Control
- Remove all intravascular catheters if feasible.
- Drain abscesses.

### Ophthalmologic Examination
- Dilated fundoscopic exam for all patients with candidemia to rule out endophthalmitis.

### Special Populations
- **Neonates**: Amphotericin B or fluconazole.
- **Neutropenic Patients**: Echinocandin or liposomal amphotericin B.

### Antifungal Prophylaxis
- Consider in high-risk ICU patients, transplant recipients, or prolonged neutropenia.
