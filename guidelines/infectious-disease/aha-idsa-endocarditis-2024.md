## Scope
2024 AHA/IDSA scientific statement on the diagnosis and management of infective endocarditis (IE) in adults.

## Key Recommendations

### Diagnosis

#### Modified Duke Criteria (2023 Revision)
- **Major Criteria**:
  - Blood cultures positive for typical IE organisms.
  - Evidence of endocardial involvement on imaging (echocardiography, CT, PET).
- **Minor Criteria**: Predisposing condition, fever, vascular phenomena, immunologic phenomena, positive blood cultures not meeting major criteria.

#### Echocardiography
- **TTE**: Initial test.
- **TEE**: Higher sensitivity, especially for prosthetic valves, complications (abscess, perforation), or inconclusive TTE.

#### Advanced Imaging
- Cardiac CT, 18F-FDG PET/CT: Useful for prosthetic valve IE, cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED) infections, and detecting extracardiac complications.

### Antibiotic Therapy
- **Empiric**: Vancomycin + ceftriaxone (or ampicillin-sulbactam) pending culture data.
- **Native Valve Streptococcal IE**: Penicillin G or ceftriaxone x 4 weeks (or 2 weeks with aminoglycoside in highly susceptible strains).
- **Staphylococcal IE (MSSA)**: Nafcillin or cefazolin x 6 weeks.
- **Staphylococcal IE (MRSA)**: Vancomycin or daptomycin x 6 weeks.
- **Prosthetic Valve IE**: Longer duration (≥6 weeks); often requires rifampin for staphylococcal infections.

### Surgery
- **Indications**: Heart failure from valve dysfunction, uncontrolled infection (abscess, enlarging vegetation despite therapy), embolic events (especially recurrent or large vegetations >10 mm), fungal or highly resistant organisms.
- Early surgical consultation is recommended.

### Prevention
- Antibiotic prophylaxis for high-risk patients (prosthetic valves, prior IE, certain CHD) undergoing dental procedures.

### PWID-Associated IE
- Multidisciplinary approach including addiction medicine. Consider harm reduction strategies.
