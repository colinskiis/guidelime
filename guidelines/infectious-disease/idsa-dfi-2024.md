## Scope
2024 IDSA guideline update on the diagnosis and treatment of diabetic foot infections (DFI), including soft tissue and bone infections.

## Key Recommendations

### Diagnosis
- **Clinical Diagnosis**: Based on signs of inflammation (purulence, erythema, warmth, tenderness, induration) in a diabetic foot wound.
- **Classify Severity**: Uninfected, mild (superficial), moderate (deeper/extensive), severe (systemic toxicity, limb-threatening).
- **Wound Culture**: Obtain from deep tissue (curettage, biopsy), NOT superficial swab. Avoid culture of clinically uninfected wounds.

### Osteomyelitis Evaluation
- **Probe-to-Bone Test**: Positive test in an infected wound has high positive predictive value for osteomyelitis.
- **Imaging**: X-ray (insensitive early); MRI is most sensitive/specific.
- **Bone Biopsy with Culture**: Gold standard for diagnosis and guides antibiotic selection.

### Antibiotic Therapy

#### Mild DFI (Superficial)
- Oral antibiotics covering gram-positive cocci (S. aureus, streptococci).
- **Agents**: Cephalexin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, or TMP-SMX/doxycycline if MRSA risk.
- Duration: 1-2 weeks.

#### Moderate-Severe DFI
- Broader coverage: gram-positive (including MRSA), gram-negative, anaerobes.
- **Agents**: Vancomycin + piperacillin-tazobactam (or carbapenem) for empiric therapy; adjust based on culture.
- Duration: 2-4 weeks for soft tissue; 4-6 weeks for osteomyelitis (without resection) or shorter if all infected bone resected.

### Surgical Management
- Urgent surgical debridement/drainage for abscesses, necrosis, gas, or limb-threatening infection.
- Amputation if non-salvageable; limb preservation is goal.

### Multidisciplinary Care
- Diabetic foot team: Infectious disease, podiatry/foot surgery, vascular surgery, wound care, endocrinology.
- Offloading, glycemic control, vascular assessment (revascularization if needed).

### Prevention
- Foot exams, patient education, appropriate footwear, prompt treatment of wounds.
